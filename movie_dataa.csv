794297796,Nathan B,"I think Disney's latest remakes of Aladdin and the Lion King are two different remake approaches that were done very well. (I loved them both!) Minus one of my favorite songs staring Pumba... 'Are you aching for some bacon?' Lion King is very much a to the script remake of the original, while Aladdin had some story changes and plot deepenings that were also very enjoyable.  The remake followed the script Verbatim, except where animals would have to do things beyond the realm of 'realism' (No pigs wearing grass skirts doing the hula) Dont understand how these 'pro' tomatometer ratings are so off, the Audience score is always the way to go... Rotten Tomato pro critics are a lil' bit special... aka stupid.",5.0,2019-09-25T06:26:06.320Z

978250850,Nathan J,"It seemed a little rushed. Some of the magical moments I remember from when I was a kid were either cut short or not there at all.
It was ok, heck if the first one didn't exist you'd even say it's a good movie, but since the first one does exist this is unnecessary.",3.0,2019-09-24T16:00:42.308Z

913207579,Haq H,No way near as good as the original.  Beyoncé is out of place doing voice over on this one.  Disney should only make original live action films as opposed to redoing its classic cartoons.,3.0,2019-09-24T02:35:06.463Z

804937834,Jonathan J,"Graphics were good.  Sadly, the voice acting was horrible and at many times didn't flow as any conversation should.  This movie felt flat and many of the ingredients which made the original so great, were missing.  ",1.5,2019-09-23T18:54:03.684Z
978281420,Roman D,"CGI was incredible!  However there was nothing new, though it was half an hour longer than the original.  Much more boring than original",2.0,2019-09-23T14:03:43.631Z
977821270,Ogr G,"While I was impressed by the level of effects used to create this remake, I couldn't help but think it was another unnecessary film from Disney. As I understand it, the budget for this film was about $250 million, the original animated film was $45 million. Disney could of made five new, original animated features with that cash. And to be honest, that makes me feel a little bit sad.

Back to the film though, the story hits all the beats from the original, Scars betrayal of his brother, Simba growing up with Timon and Pumba, his eventual return. The songs are fun and again, the effects are very good. I honestly forgot at thimes that this is a CGI movie. It'll easily entertain the kids, but to be honest, I'd put the original on and give them some of the old Disney magic and imagination (that they nicked from Osamu Tezuka and Kimba, the White Lion, oooo!).",2.0,2019-09-23T13:58:12.243Z

977889555,Reba M,So so movie.  I liked the Old one.  Could be that I enjoyed it when I was a kid.  My younger sibs enjoyed it.  But they were saying the entire dialog thru out the movie.   I am sure they made it a more interesting exp for some people.  They were getting more laughs and attention then the movie screen.,2.5,2019-09-23T12:32:43.999Z

978277564,Ben C,"This movie should never ever have been made. Whoever watches this and likes mor than the first one, you should be chucked off rotten tomatoes forever. Walt Disney would be turning in his grave right now because he wouldn't want the original cartoon to be changed like that. Nalas voice sounded like an old lady, pumba wasn't a very good warthog he looked like a farm pig with tusks glued on his face, Timone looked like the last meerkat left in the pet shop that no one wanted. Rafiki, now don't get me started on that blue arsed baboon. Zazu looked like a manky old bird, Rowan Atkinson never have taken the role no matter how poor he is unless the Simba role was offered to him.
Even though the music was so poor the acting was worse. Simba couldn't sing, Nala or should I say Beyoncé has lost her voice. The poorest ever, it would never hold a candle to the original 1994 version. If I could give zero stars I would so be thankful with half. This should never have been remade. They ruined it just like hey did to Aladdin and don't get me started on jungle book. Please don't mess up Mulan I'm begging you please don't.",0.5,2019-09-25T12:29:54.856Z

954262172,David G,This film had potential. But it was basically a clone of the animated series. The cgi looks great. But the story was just to identical. Just stick with the cartoon.,1.5,2019-09-22T11:52:07.622Z
978278399,Alpaca  D,"This movie is an insult to fans of the original Lion King, it takes away all the magic the original movie had by sticking to realistic animation which doesn't allow any exaggerated movements or human like expressions, Simba has the same expression when he sees a bug and when his father was murdered. The animals look to realistic, they are thin, angry looking, colorless slabs of no emotion. Not to mention the script was not change one bit its as if Disney has reached an all time low which it has. don't waste your money to buy this once it comes out on dvd, you'd have more fun watching the Playmobil Movie.",0.5,2019-09-22T02:41:20.560Z

978276890,Carol C,The CGI is so extraordinary that it's hard to believe it's not real. The story is the same - as it should be - and I wonder whether that's why some critics are less than positive. This is a beautiful remake of the original animated feature that does not disappoint.,4.0,2019-09-21T12:04:15.753Z
978264528,Rud A,"To begin with, I am a fan of Disney cartoons, and my childhood passed watching their cartoons every day. However, I did not like this remake of Lion King because I think that this remake is very realistic, and they could not show the emotions and mimics of heroes. So according to me, it looks like a zoo with an old and masterpiece plot.",3.5,2019-09-21T05:44:03.483Z

978275517,Twyla H,"Waste of time. An all real animal cast lost it's expression and connection. Beyonce's voice is more Sarabi than Nala. Donald Glover was fantastic as Simba. Seth Rogan nailed it.

978273984,Delano F,I felt like the movie dragged a bit and the emotionless expressions on the characters faces was just hard to watch. Some of the voice actors didn't go well with the characters in the film. Overall I walked out of the film wishing I didn't spend $13 on this ticket!,2.0,2019-09-19T21:03:08.936Z

931412053,Matthew L,"A souless cash grab.

I can't believe this made 1 billion at the box office. Like why? It's literally the same movie! Some of the voice acting wasn't that good, especially Beyoncé who's extremely bad here. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a great actor, but he was painfully miscast as Scar. They should've just brought back Jeremy Irons. Mufasa death scene was pretty laughable. The visual effects on the animals may look photorealistic and amazing, but soul and heart isn't there.

977459800,Julian M,"Though beautiful, this remake strips away the heart that made its original counterpart so special. While I do appreciate Jon Favreau's effort to portray emotion through body language, cinematography, and lighting, the end result is too bound to the rules of reality for its own good.

While it's worth one viewing for its gorgeous visuals, 'The Lion King (2019)' is a forgettable and soulless recreation that I personally hate.",1.0,2019-09-19T04:25:34.282Z
978272492,Ashlee T,"The visuals were great but 90% of the movie was word for word the same as the 1994 original movie. This made it almost impossible not to compare the line delivery to the first film. There was also a lack of emotional intensity and enthusiasm that the original delivered so well. Timon and Pumba however, were redone in a fresh way staying true to the beloved characters but bringing new laughs. The hyena's also deserve some props for bringing a fresh spin on the original characters. These characters along with the graphics are the reason that I am giving this three stars instead of 2.
Overall, it was entertaining, but unlike its original, it was a one-time watch for me.

978254498,Ashleigh P,"The CGI is breathtaking. And the music, especially the new songs, are awesome! I like how there was a much greater variety of background species than we saw in the original, and it seems that Disney has shifted the hyena society this time around so that is governed by a female. This is awesome...because hyenas are a matriarchal, female-dominated species in real life! Despite this, it seems the (supposed) inbreeding of Simba and Nala is something Disney has yet to set straight but I suppose that might be really difficult/pointless to do as so much of the storyline revolves around that romance and so many people seem to overlook this glitch. Scar appeared to be much darker, with clearer motivations, than in the original. I'm not sure if it's just me but he also comes across as more blatantly sociopathic.

However, this is a very nostalgic movie for many people, and for that reason alone I doubt it'll live up to its reputation.",4.5,2019-09-18T20:31:16.377Z

978119638,Shaan S,"A basic remake of the 1994 original that feels hollow in almost every way. Disney needs to understand that just because they remake a film that has appealed to us for years, it doesn't mean it helms the true emotion in what made the original amazing. Don't think that is the case? The 1994 original film struck us by the heart with its dazzling animation, great soundtrack and memorable moments. This 2019 remake was a legitimate copy and paste of the original (with a few new lines of dialgoue thrown in). Add in some mediocre CGI at times and you have the recipe for a terrible film. It's souless yet filled with nostalgia as it appeals to us who have watched the original in the time it came out. Do people like it? Of course, as its box office performance can attest to that. Do they need to see it? No. They would be better off enjoying the original and its true sentiments. I have no interest seeing this remake again, even if it's rich with nostalgia and has James Earl Jones as the only actor reprising his role from the original.",2.0,2019-09-17T14:18:17.066Z

At least Aladdin (2019) updated some things, this is practically a copy and paste of the original script. In that regard it is disappointing.

I would too, ordinarily, but I was quite entertained and enthralled by Disney's remake of this classic. For one thing, the story material itself is so strong that any lack of originality in the story is actually welcome! With Hollywood's never ending obsession with SJW politics and inserting sexuality and profanity for it's own sake it is really nice that Jon Favreau decided NOT to ""update or improve"" the story! Also, having the great James Earl Jones return as Mustafa was a great choice. He, like his character has a very regal quality and timbre to his voice that is, for this roll, absolute perfection. (Although as a big Star Wars geek, I remember turning to my wife during his first encounter with Scar and asking snarkily why he just doesn't Force choke him!) Dominall Gleeson and Beyonce are also wonderful and Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Scar is as magnificently conniving and chillingly evil as one could expect. The movie is visually stunning and should look even more breathtakingly beautiful when it ones out on Disney+ with a good HDR 4K television. So, especially if you haven't seen the original, see this one on a big screen with Dolby Atmos, and then watch the original at home for kicks.

If you're going to remake a classic movie, you have to give it something different, something that makes us feel like it was worth doing, and because the 1994 original was essentially a perfect movie to begin with, this remake just seemed kind of pointless.

956915141,Guy S,"Do you remember The Polar Express with Tom Hanks voicing a conductor on a fantasy train?  Do you remember why the movie flopped?  One reason was that the animation was too life-like.  Humans don't like animations to look too real because it gives us the creeps.
Lion King 2019 fails in many ways and unfortunately its greatest achievement, the near-to-life rendering of the characters is also one of its biggest downfalls.  Having an almost real animal talk and show human emotions just looks wrong.  In the original animated movie, because of relatively simple animation, the audience could suspend their disbelief and could accept the personification, but the 2019 movie is just plain creepy.  It would be like remaking the original Mickey Mouse movies using a real mouse.

Moving on, I have to ask the question ""Why was the movie made?"" The original was tight, fast paced and above all it was funny.  The interplay between Timon and Pumba is legendary. In the 2019 version, not so much. It is as if Disney wanted to explain the jokes of the original, and those that they couldn't explain they just left out.  One of my favourite lines from Timon was when they introduced Simba to their diet.  ""Let's rustle up some grub."" (digs in a log) ""Aha! a grub!"".   Short, sharp and funny.  In 2019 the line is missing.  Instead the forest animals point out the different types of grubs. The Lion King just went from comedy to documentary.

My kids grew up on the Lion King (on VHS), so much so that I knew the first 10 minutes of script out of my head. They loved the animation, I loved the jokes.  I am interested to see who this 2019 version was aimed at.

Sorry Disney.  Well done on the real life animation, but if you want to make dark Shakespearian movies, please don't rehash an old favourite.  ",1.5,2019-09-09T07:56:30.747Z

On top of that the saturation in this film is pretty low, giving it a dull and boring look that is nowhere near as gorgeous as The Jungle Book remake. A remake is supposed to add and fix things that need fixing in the original, be different and stand out on it's own but this just took away. Now I am not saying that it should be like the Little Mermaid Remake from 2018 or like the maleficent movie, but I am saying that when you are going to remake a beloved classic that we have already seen before, add more heart and depth into the characters (especially when all the characters are emotionless cgi animals). They even make the Mufasa Death scene somehow funny and it sound bad to say but it was probably the most funny part of the whole entire film. It was funny because of the bad CGI in that specific scene, weird directing, camera movements and voice acting and because there is absolutely no depth or weight in that scene. I could go on but I will just stop ranting and finish this with one message; People, for Pete's sake, stop giving Disney YOUR money from YOUR pocket every time they make a remake (more like a cash grab then an actual remake).",1.5,2019-09-08T20:34:15.173Z

If doing a reboot of the original exactly why even change the voices just use the original voices no need to even get new voice actors and pay attention to getting the movement on point to match that as well as pay closer attention to the subtle real expressions a lion would naturally have.",1.5,2019-09-08T06:54:07.273Z

978037480,Ido D,"""The Lion King"" was a very problematic film, even in its 1994 cartoon. Fascist perceptions of power adoration, conservative mortality, patriarchal nurturing, focusing on the world of males - all did not stop him from becoming one of Disney Studios' favorite works.
Now, in his photo-realistic version, another problem emerged: not only could the images seem cruel and direct to the young audience, but the human dimension that accompanied the savannah animals in the original film was gone. Think of a pumba that is nothing more than a talking warthog, with no real personality, in Seth Rogen's vital speech that only highlights the limited scope of the photo-realistic facial expressions.
The ""Lion King"" model of 2019 is nothing more than an impressive technological vision. And yes, another way to enrich the cashier of Disney Studios. Why think of something new, if you can just do a cover version of the old one? None of the new releases Disney has created so far will become a classic that will accompany children and their parents into the future. Maximum, in 25 years they will produce a new film that will use future technology. Maybe by then they will also be able to engineer emotion.
One cannot help but be impressed by the technological achievements of ""The Lion King,"" and in this respect director John Favreau transcends the visuals offered by his previous Disney adaptation, ""The Jungle Book"" (2016). At the same time, it is precisely the realistic images that are damaging to what worked well in the previous film - the songs. Digital animals look very unconvincing as they begin to sing and move in rhythm, and if ""The Jungle Book"" Favreau gave up all but one of the songs - it seemed possible and desirable here too. ""The Hakone Hookah"" would have worked better as a whistle in the background, and not like the lumbering and magic processing of the current version, which evokes any trace of the animation's original and expressive possibilities. It is enough to see the differences between the two versions to understand.
The film's technological achievements do indeed make us feel like we're in a real jungle. But digital breakthrough enthusiasm does not come at the expense of emotion and soul. This is more of a rehearsal than an attempt to recreate the film (as Julie Taimor did in her successful stage-musical adaptation). Another victim is Zazu, the goofy chicken (Light Knight host John Oliver), who has trouble delivering comic merchandise with a limited range of expressions stemming from realistic animation. At least flying is successful.
The main question that arises in view of ""The Lion King"" is: Why, exactly? After all, it's not exactly a remake, nor an adaptation that offers a reinterpretation of the movie, which was Disney's first based on an original story. The feeling that accompanies us throughout the watching is of blatant exploitation. This is a film that does not come to resume but to squeeze. Its purpose is not to breathe life (something the original movie doesn't need anyway), but to declare: ""Look at me!"" The lions, hyenas, warthog, and Suricata are therefore more reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein's creature than real animals.",3.5,2019-09-07T20:40:40.513Z

With modern film technology and advanced computer graphics this movie per it's budget should have been much better than it is. The big scenes compared to the traditional animation are lackluster and not so dynamic, and the musical numbers are sadly dialed way back and lack the enthusiasm of the previous voices.

When Nala has been chasing pumba and found out that Simba has been ""ALIVE"" for all this time, 

In the 94's version: there's chock, there's mourning, there's some kind of enthusiasm in the movie.
the 2019's version regarding that scene is more ""Meh, ok, you're alive and that's kind of it..."" 

It's so bad and I'm sorry that Disney couldn't direct a movie director in the same path as they did before ... worse movie ever!

Another thing about it is that, I get that they want to make it look as real as possible with this remake but you can't feel the characters, everyone looks the same if they are either happy or mourning for someones death .. there's no feeling to the movie, editing and removing scenes (when nala and sima roll around from the hill and down, it doesn't exist ...!!) ...

The cast has no enthusiasm in this movie, just hire the old cast or use the voices of the old cast and shoot it that way instead .. it's so emotionless so you don't feel for the movie anymore .. a complete waste of money! Worst movie ever!",0.5,2019-09-06T18:15:30.006Z

Born in 95, it was the first film I ever saw in my life with 1967 Jungle Book where my love for animals was born. This remake brings its own the heart, energy, soul, and emotions of the realism of wildlife in Africa with the same story we know and love. Something we all take for granted, that needs to be appreciated in this film as 1000s of species are going extinct every year. That's the circle of life Jon Favreau wanted us to really think about while watching the remake. Real animals are a part of our lives, in the animal kingdom they too have stories to tell. That they also can in body human souls, emotions, grief, heart, tragedy, and triumph even if we can't see it the same way.

You just watch at pseudo-realistic animals, which can't show us real emotions cause they are an animals. When you don't look at the screen and hear voice-actors, you can compare pictures from the original movie and remake in your mind and it works, but if you look at the screen there is dissonance- dools without any emotion and people behind the scene, who try to put some humanity in picture and it looks very weird. Artificially strached useless scenes, like the scene with mouse at the beginning, which provided just to show us how good the modern technologies and CGI and where budget money have been provided. So, according to all this fact i can make a conclusion that film was maded only for getting money from generation who has grew up on Disney's original The Lion King story.

978226318,Dean D,"As a person who walked into The Lion King 2019, with no past baggage or childhood nostalgia, I'd say this was quite a pleasant experience.

Let's go over the pros -for starters, this film is visually incredible,no doubt about it. There are legitimate moments where I would believe that these are real animals in the wild; they look,act and sound like their realistic counterparts. It's a beautiful movie to watch.

The humor,when it's there,is incredible. I am,of course, referring to Timon and Pumba. I have no idea how they performed in the original,but I'm sold on a Lion King 1.5 sequel. They share genuine banter, which really lighten the tone of the film.

In terms of negatives, you've probably already heard,but the film is pretty bland. The lions have no real emotion, nor are they allowed to,cause it would be hard to animate. In that sense,this comes off as a nature documentary, with A-list actors performing mediocre dubs. I don't even blame the actors,it's just that since the animation is so real, the emotions couldn't be. Speaking of which, there's also a weird disconnect between scenes that are clearly meant to be brutal (the stampede, the final fight),but are toned down to PG13 . It takes you slightly off rhythm, because you want it to be real,but you know Disney won't show you the blood and gore.

All in all, I'd say this film works best as a chapter in a photorealism course for budding visual effects artists. I enjoyed it (having nothing to compare to), but if anything, it's gotten me excited to see the original,as well as the Broadway play. I know there's better versions out there, so I'm comfortable not thinking too much about this one.",4.0,2019-09-02T19:43:09.475Z

(I would've just watched Lion King (original) if it was basically going to be the same dialect. ) Also the voices could have been better. (Maybe not the voices, but the voice directing) The characters sound as though they just went through the script once and the director just went with the first take. And the Simba (kid VO) just seemed like he was trying to hard to sound like Simba and wasn't trying to act like him.(He had a good voice I just think the director could have helped him understand Simba's character a bit more so his voice would be convincing to the audience).

The animation is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Seriously, its an achievement in itself.  And seeing the animals express themselves with physical body language hit me harder than the animated version.

And yet its true what you've heard - the photorealism does take away much of the energy and magic that was present in the animated version.  The animals can't emote much, and many, if not all, of the musical sequences fall flat.

Scar as a whole is terrible - they made an artistic choice to portray him as somewhat mangy and sickly looking, which does not make for an intimidating villain.  And his iconic ""Be Prepared"" sequence is only memorable for how flat and terrible it was.

If you're interested in seeing an achievement in animation technology, give this a shot, but otherwise I can't recommend it.  The original is infinitely better, and this version is more of an experimental experience than a true classic.",3.5,2019-08-31T23:32:57.236Z

The Lion King is Disney's 3rd Live-Action remake this year. And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.

The original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it ""Live-Action"", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.
I was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!

The Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.

The movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!

The casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!

The movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.

The Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!

I'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!

978212416,Bubbas V,"The Lion King is Disney latest and the most anticipated live-action remake of the year! While it can take pride in its graphics and looks, the film overall loses me within several things that are crucial to the Lion King.  

  Firstly, the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in the film sounds unnatural and like they were purely reading from a script.  Some of the highlighted talent in the film would have to be Seth Rogen (Pumba), Billy Eicher (Timon), and JD McCary (Young Simba) and the rest of the Hyena trio. James Earl Jones was okay but didn't surprise me at all with his performance. However, the voice of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is exceptionally good. 

  Secondly, the lack of emotions on pretty much every character. One of the many things that the animated '94 film got away with was the emotions. It was animated so biology never really played a factor. Due to the realism of the film, the dance sequences/songs, and many of the character development scenes felt flat and bland. While I enjoyed the dance sequences it just felt bland at the same time. Specifically the I Can't-Wait to be King scene fell far down due to realism.  I was seriously and mentally preparing myself for the death of Mufasa and sadly while it was still sad and the same besides one iconic shot being change, the entire sequence felt emotionless and nearly didn't affect as much as it did back in 1994. 

  In conclusion, I enjoyed The Lion King for what it was. It was a bland re-telling of the beloved classic. While I loved some changes added to Nala's character and the epic fight sequence, the film overall fell flat for me.

883901140,Xavier P,"😁I just saw the Lion King and I have to say.........
I was bored out of my mind. It's rant time:

😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it's animals in this movie.

😡However, I've got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.
.
1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that's the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. 

2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying ""Is that a challenge?!"". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.

1+2=3) With one and two combined, it's just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba's pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.

4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. 

What do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC's animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character's emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. 

The battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were ""protected"" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...

5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. 
Ok, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. 

The movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. 

Anyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.",2.0,2019-08-27T18:38:44.923Z

978099203,Victor M,"This movie was visually gorgeous as one would expect but in the end it just felt rushed. From the opening sequence it felt shorter and less grandiose than the original. The voice actors did a good job but not great. The originals did a much better job of selling their personalities as animals where this version failed to suspend the disbelief. Many of the moments felt like a person singing the songs rather than the actual characters. It also seemed like they changed each song slightly to fit the voice actors strengths rather than casting someone that could pull off the original ensembles. Overall it was a good watch because it was just visually breathtaking, but as whole this really falls flat considering the high hopes and expectations set for such a classic and nostalgic movie.

How this film could boast such an amazing cast and yet seem so incredibly badly cast is a total mystery.

978211654,Jesse P,"This movie was not great.  It was not even okay.  It was a complete and utter cash grab of a film.  My girlfriend and I left shortly after the gorge scene because we could not stand this film.  

My single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.

The significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact — scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. 

Upon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.
 
The film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.

All animals look so realistic that you can't differentiate between them and those in
National Geographic's documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is
one of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to
show expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,
which will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological
authenticity.
It would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994's version as
childhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always
be better than the later one.
As an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their
bonding, Mufasa's philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can
easily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father's
paw, the scene is literally heart touching.
Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both
characters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy ""Hakuna Matata""
which was opposite of Mufasa's Philosophy.
There is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and
perfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.",4.0,2019-08-24T13:31:42.221Z

The problem is that they *didn't* recreate the original scenes to properly represent the original. I feel like they could have easily included more emotion and time for important scenes (which is what the audience is specifically interested in for nostalgia). The movie simply feels rushed. It seems like, because the main focus of this film was for the CGI to be breathtaking, that there wasn't enough attention to other important factors when it comes to creating movies. Timing, improvisation, and being more careful with details doesn't seem to have been on their minds. l did enjoy this movie, but when it's clear that so much could have easily been corrected to make the film better, it's disappointing.

So, when we heard about the remake 25 years later we were excited and went to see it together again. The effects are nice, but they're not, because the characters lacked the heart and emotion and humor of the first film. It just wasn't the same at all. And Scar's character was completely different.

The scenes that the movie does change are weird and makes me question why like instead of Simba accidentally  sending some dust to Rafiki through wind. NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop . Do you remember that scene where Rafiki  hits Simba on his heas and says that it doesnt matter because it is in the past that is GONE all GONE , but why it was the a moral of the story . Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you've read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It's fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy ""Come-ons!"" and ""Let's do this!"" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce's character literally yells ""Lions, Attack!""  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala.

977719088,Mani P,"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.

The film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.

The story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.

The voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.

The characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.

The animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.

The colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.

The soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyoncé and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyoncé's song Spirit.

The emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.

The film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.

Over all I give it a 
1/10 - would never recommend

But unfortunately there's some not so great things with this movie. A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.",2.0,2019-08-17T08:38:03.301Z

With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars ""Be Prepared"" song.

978199037,anonymous  s,"okay, first of all, I would like to say somethings that need to be said about the critics that aren't giving it fair reviews.
First, the reason why games like call of duty and FIFA get high reviews are that a lot of critics are not allowed to make a direct compare to others in a series you can make small parts saying like the characters cannot show emotion like the cartoon but you cannot flat out say the first film better therefor this film was bad.
now on to my review 
_________________________________________________
due to them trying to be realistic it did affect some parts of the movie mostly singing and showing emotion what I mean by this is the singing isn't as clean as you would think the characters sound more like Les Mis where they are more talking through the music and more noise from background fx I don't think many people would like to hear big splash sounds after every step in a song if they are in water oddly it didn't happen in every song just a few 
now with how the characters show emotion oddly, they didn't do a bad job I would say but  some characters have the blank face though the whole movie. They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.
Shouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it 
I would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say

790384741,Samantha L,"The animation was beautiful, the score (Other than Beyonce's added track) was phenomenal, however the voice acting was something left to be desired. By creating this photo-realistic version you are losing out on the emotion that hand-drawn animation offers, I believe in order to make up for this some real emphasis on the voice acting was needed. The voice acting was bland, dry, and did not make up for the lack of emotion realistic characters needed. I would take the original voice acting, put it over top since its almost scene for scene, and cut out the unnecessary bits (Like Scar basically becoming an incel because Sarabi chose Mufasa over him) And you would have a perfect, photo-realistic carbon copy. 

This truly lacked the depth and emotion the original had, and I blame it all on the lack of emotion in these characters voices; (Even James Earl's voice lacked the depth he had in the original.) ",2.5,2019-08-13T20:32:57.836Z

	Initial Reaction: How is this going to be different than the cartoon version?
	Main Characters
	Simba, Nala: Two lions voiced by Donald Glover and Beyonce
	TImon, Pumbaa: A meerkat/warthog combo voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen

	Plot Summary (for those who didn't see the animated film)
	Lions rule the land where the movie takes place.  The king and queen just brought in their newest baby, Simba.
	But their brother (or brother in law),Scar (with a name like that, how can he NOT be evil?), schemes to get the throne.  Using the help of the hyenas, he gets the kign killed and Simba ousted out of the kingdom.
	But the lion cub gets some help from a warthog and a meerkat, then the spirit of his dead father, then his ""friend"", Nala.

SCORING
	Main Characters
	The main characters most of us know and love are here and they are just as good and we remember them.  SCORE: 9

	Supporting Cast
	They give Nala a bit more personality because, well, she's the leading lady.  Still, we get some good moments from a baboon, a bird and the hyenas themselves.  SCORE: 8

	Plot
	The plot is easy to follow, and it has a few nice twists.  But they add a few new scenes that felt more like padding.  SCORE: 6

	Originality
	This particular Disney remake does the least changes to the animated version – which makes me wonder why make the live action in the first place (other than to show off some impressive CGI.  SCORE: 3

	Violence Factor
	There's a lot of fights between lions and hyenas (I thought I was watching a nature documentary during those fights).  But the fights do get a tiring.  SCORE: 7

	Other Moral Issues
	This film does a great job of showing how to take responsibility for your actions and how to overcome obstacles and situations.  But it does go overboard with the girl empowerment bit.  SCORE: 8

	Final Score (out of 60): 41		% Score: 68.33%
	It's a good film – if you haven't seen the animated version.  But it doesn't do much to make it stand apart from that version. 	",3.5,2019-08-13T19:49:16.624Z

788075726,Jack W,"Found this computer-generated remake to be an entertaining on the whole with a few caveats.

The movie looks so amazing and photo-realistic. The background in particular is really impressive, I'm surprised this film had only one real setting shot. You really can't tell the difference between this landscape and the real world. Director John Favreau (Iron Man; Jungle Book) has some interesting shots in this. At times, the movie feels like a nature documentary.

Plotwise, this is probably the least ambitious of the recent Disney remakes. Unlike Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which clung to the plot structure of the originals but also added new elements, this one just retells the basic story. Still, I'm not hating it. This isn't the 90's Psycho. It's not word-by-word. What works for me here is that the jokes are almost all new and they work really well.

Cast is decent. All the funny characters jive. Donald Glover as adult Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar do a good job as the hero and villain. However, Beyonce as adult Nala sometimes really comes across as reading off the page without a whole lot of effort.

The background music really sells the scenes, but admittedly Hans Zimmer basically just rehashes the music from the first film.

This contains all the classic songs from the original. However, ""Be Prepared"" has been changed to a half-it's-length spoken word song with reworked lyrics. I know at one point the news was that they were cutting this song. (Either for time or Ejiofor just didn't have the pipes.) I'm guessing this was added back due to the backlash but modified to accomodate either or both of the potential issues just mentioned. I actually would've preferred if they left the song out rather than going with this neutered version, which doesn't quite work.

If you feel that the recent Disney remakes are soulless cashgrabs, this really won't be the one to change your mind. Despite coasting with the story, I personally found this to be engaging.",3.5,2019-08-13T04:16:52.036Z

I felt like I was watching a nature documentary that someone had added a voice over (but not well). It's like the voices didn't really gel with the creatures, and the audio levels never seemed to balance properly (sometimes too loud for the scene, other times too quiet, eg the character would be forefront but sound like they were in the distance, and in the distance but sound like they were beside you).
 
The characters were amazingly realistic....to the point that they were basically emotionless and therefore I didn't feel any connection with them.

Also...I know she's ""queen B"", but Beyonce really needs to learn that, in a duet, there's no lead - both voices need to blend together in unison. Instead, I felt like she was determined for her voice to be the star. In contrast, they made it a humour point when the actual star started riffing, which was clever, but then they were fine to have the supporting cast vocals over-power the lead..?

While they rightly portray a world of over-hunting large prey animals as unsustainable for predators, they counter that with presenting Paradise as a grub-eating world which couldn't support the large predators at all.  

Lion King II doesn't really improve the position.  It inserts this preachy ""straight line theory"" that shames the grub eaters as oblivious to the idea that everything is connected, While Still Presenting Their World As Paradise.

Yes, the emotions aren't displayed as greatly as in the original, but that's a given, and the voice acting and the phenomenal music accompanying the scenes make up for it.

That's the big question that will be on most audience members minds when going to see the (supposedly) live action adaptation of the masterpiece which is the lion king. Just like the great quantity of remakes from Disney classics that have been released before it this movie relies greatly on nostalgia. Although many people would say this is an awful way to further the art which is feature film making. It does work and I found my self enjoying this film throughout, with great songs, voice work and the most photorealistic environment I've ever seen. Without ever felling like a so-called cash grab which we all know it to be. Unfortunately, it does make people think that the geniuses that worked on the original film aren't appreciated as they should be. It's as if people are taking credit for work they did years ago. But if you come into this film hoping for a beautiful, fun experience which reminds you of how great this company is then you will be more than happy. ",3.5,2019-08-10T22:50:16.183Z

This was by far the worst reenactment of a movie I've seen so far. The movie lacked all the things that made Lion King so special. Disney needs to stop remaking movies and work to find creativity that once drove Disney again. This is sad. All the remakes that are coming out only to tarnish the original movie. This movie lacked so much, it felt as though they were reading off a script. Just please stop! This is embarrassing to those who grew up watching this classics. STOP!",0.5,2019-08-10T20:34:32.217Z

All that computer power couldn't save the bad creative decisions from the director. He was so adamant about photorealism that he didn't stop to think about the lack of expressions the characters had throughout the movie.

I hope they release a remastered sometime in the future, one with actual face animation.

Beyoncé did not having any heart or passion for her character and she was too overpowering in the duets, she wanted to be heard and it ruined them.

978179874,Brandon R,"Some movies are just too good the first time around. 

The visuals were incredible. Truly, it was difficult most of the time to tell where real turned into graphics. 

I feel bad even writing this because I do kind of cringe when things not related to a movie are brought in as a measure. That being said, I can't dismiss some of the small quirky moments of the animated film that really made it endearing. 

Whoopi's Mufasa shiver...I don't know how you would replicate it but that changes the whole atmosphere of the Hyenas. Simba getting knocked on the head. Classic moments. 

Simba's return seemed less impactful in this version. Didn't feel the struggle and importance of that decision like in the animated version. 

I didn't care for Donald Glover's rendition of Simba. One of the things about James Earl Jones is that is voice is so clear, he annunciates every syllable, he delivers with a fervent performance, he has power, clarity, and meaning. I didn't feel that with Mr. Glover. Fair comparison to anyone? Not really, but I didn't feel anything for his performance here. I feel really bad for anyone who has to sing opposite Beyonce. Even most professional recording artists.

978093617,Austin M,"It lacked the emotion of the original and did not add enough new things to make it its own version.
The CGI looks pretty damn good but the fact it is using the look of real animals makes none of the characters show any emotion on their faces when they need it. With that thought, the voice work for those hard emotional scenes wasn't there either, Mufasa's death felt less impact full due to the actors lines not hitting right.
Some scenes were not emphasized on enough while others to much, such as the opening where we follow the little mouse, we dont need to follow it for a whole minute and a half, it adds nothing to the picture. While on the other hand the whole ""Be Prepared"" song number was basically gutted from the film and replaced with the last few lines being ""Talk Sung"" by Scar, another scene taken out, and probably one of the most important, being the scene where Rafiki gives his words of wisdom about learning from the past.

In the end it is just a cash grab because people will go see these films no matter what, but I have a feeling none will be very good, let alone surpass the original Disney pictures",2.5,2019-08-09T22:36:42.523Z

978191492,Distracted _,I think it's a fun and inducing movie and a great remaster if the original Lion King. I like how Disney is remaking their old classics to appeal to the new generation of our audiences. I think they did a good job on the animation and almost all the animals looked realistic. One complaint I do have though is the audio. Disney used the original audio from the first movie which I think is a good choice it's just that Disney didn't remaster the audio. At some points it sounds like the audio was recorded on a $10 microphone rather than the new high-quality mics. The lip-syncing with the animation sometimes doesn't look good. I'm surprised that that happened because Disney is known for their masterful animation and how they try to make their movies as perfect as possible.

There is no question that the special effects look real, as though there are live animals speaking and interacting with each other.  The kids particularly liked the comic routine of Pumba and Timon (yes, especially the farting!), and their various forest friends.  But what struck me about this movie was the extraordinary precision with which it hewed to the plot of its animated predecessor, with characters, scene, and sequence virtually identical (as well as the songs, which is understandable; and, I think, even the dialogue).  I'm going to look out for the extent to which other Disney live-action successors replicate their canonical referents.

901376268,Michael M,"Well, the original was better.  It's fine, and ultimately impressive.  Really, there is a lot to admire about the movie, but still it can't escape the shadow of the original.  The weird thing is despite being longer a lot of times it feels like it's rushing through the beats of the original.  Most notably, Mufasa's death scene (spoiler's I guess) feels weirdly rushed.  I remember in the original there was time dwelling on Simba looking at the body and begging for Mufasa to get up.  Here, he just kinda looks at it, sniffles a bit, and the scene moves on.  Look I'm not saying it needs to be a shot for shot remake, but if you are going to go through the effort of doing the exact same scenes, either do them better, or do them at least as good, don't just rush through them to check off a box.

They were allowed to improvise and give their own spin with new lines and humor.  They even have a new philosophy and debate on Hakuna Matata versus Circle of Life that's actually genuinely interesting.

And to add insult to a classic scene. .  the iconic, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" scene, was played out in broad daylight; with Beyonce unleashing unbridled vocal runs over the classic song.  . A hot mess.

An uncanny remake.

978190746,Ibitayo B,"I went to watch this movie with my mom and my four year old brother (it was his birthday). My mom fell asleep at one point, my brother fell asleep, and I was about to at some points of the movie. This was at a 3:00 pm showing. Don't get me wrong the effects in this movie were fantastic but it doesn't mean anything if I don't feel anything from seeing it. The theme of the movie was lost by the long transitions from scene to scene by Disney trying to show off their technical skills. Therefore, the feeling and emotion evoked from the faces and surroundings of the original Lion King were completely lost. I gave it a star because the singing from the actors were great, and added half a star because of the background visuals.

It felt like I was watching a primary school children's half-hearted, frame-by-frame stage-version remaking of the original, only without the potential laughs, heart and comedy that could be expected.  Visually, the film was pretty impressive, but in terms of action, emotion or drama, it felt as flat as a steamrollered pancake.

Even James Earl Jones's return as Mufasa felt like he lost his power as a lion. Besides very few changes, because they were ""new,"" it's all the same exact story. Animation gives a chance to bring expression and life and creativity. You could watch a nature documentary about the Safari, slap a Lion King label and it would be better than this.

978189805,Kai H,"The visuals in this movie are impressive. The photo realism is astounding, but that's not all this movie should've been. The story was a copy and paste of the original, much like a video game remake. The voice acting was subpar at some points. Some of the most influential scenes (Mufasas death, Scars musical number, Hakuna Matata) were dull and lifeless BECAUSE of the photo realism. The characters can't emote properly so some of the body movements are exaggerated, but then it gives the characters an uncanny valley vibe. One of the best Disney villain songs in my opinion was completely scraped and only had a hint of the original song towards the very end, but even then it wasn't there. Because this is photorealistic, there's no creativity. What should've been inspiration, was just there to be a template to animate over. The lack of facial expressions kills this whole movie. When Simba sees his father dead on the gorge floor in the original, he is so expressive and it makes you feel what Simba is feeling in that moment. In the remake, all of that emotion is lost. No expression, no emotion. If they were making this for a bunch of lions, I'm sure they'd be thankful for the accuracy, but the movie isn't for LIONS it's for HUMANS. Humans rely on facial emotion to properly understand what's happening. Animals (especially felines) don't. They rely on body language. But a lot of people can't read animals. That's why cats are seen as aloof and uncaring. Their owners can't read them. If people aren't able to read real life animals, how are they supposed to read the body language of an imitated animal? So many influential scenes were removed and so many tedious and useless characters were added (ie the animals in the jungle) all for the sake of a joke or a sixty second song. The scene with Mufasas ghost in the clouds was barely recognizable for me in theaters because all I saw was a bunch of clouds with the occasional lightning. When you take one of the worlds most known films and attempt a remake, you should improve on it. Don't try to change the formula. Leave some realistic elements in, but don't try to make it look like I just spent twenty bucks on a movie ticket to watch a National Geographic documentary. This movie was lifeless and a copy paste, but with better graphics. ",0.5,2019-08-07T07:49:06.672Z
978189792,ro h,"Shot for shot remake of the Disney animated version only with worse voice acting and loss of levity. 

Donald Glover was good and James Earl Jones is still James Earl Jones, but the rest of the cast was far inferior to the original. The realistic appearance of everything is rather amazing, but the realism takes away from the humorous elements that were in the original.

While they have shorter more rushed dialoged in other scene. There is one noted new scene where you see Nala leave pride rock and some add time with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. If you where thinking with the extra run time they would add more heart and soul the characters backround and story they don't. The songs do not even come close to the original. 'Cant wait to be king' is  just okay at best, they don't even try with Scar 'be prepared', and 'can you feel the love tonight' is just there. ",2.0,2019-08-07T02:48:50.550Z

Disney castrated them all, because God forbid kids see reproductive organs (eyeroll). Third, there is a lot of violence, very inappropriate for a family movie.

Quite frankly, it's very disappointing that a proclaimed movie critic would give this movie such a low rating. For one, this movie is NOT to be compared to the original. Lions with facial expressions make it very appealing to the younger audience. However, this movie is life changing and a huge leap in the movie industry. Of course, they won't give a virtually real looking lion eyebrows that leave their face. It is up to the audience to listen and experience in order to get a feel for what this movie is expressing. Yes, that means use your own imagination. The Lion King has opened so many doors and it's hard to think of an new animated movie that could possible beat this one. Everything was fantastic. A lot of critics will say that they left out important messages that the original movie inputted. However, by watching, laughing, sympathizing, and gaining a connection through this experience does anything but lack those messages. It is truly a masterpiece and I will watch it over and over again with the same mind blowing expression on my face.",5.0,2019-08-06T19:56:43.036Z

I have to say, the artisty of using CGI was pretty darn good, but having pretty pictures and animation to almost lifelike characters and scenes wasnt enough to save this movie. The voice over of the animals made it seem more fake than anything, and seriously,  this was an animated movie in 1994 there was really a lack of expression and character from start to finish. If disney  is going to remake such an iconic movie such as The Lion King at least try and make it decent and not like a children's documentary movie with poorly talking animals and dull expressions. Nevertheless the story was more to the original Hamlet, which definitely shows disney takes the hard work of others and spins it off for their entertainment and financial benefit.

Timon and Pumbaa have new jokes, Chiwetel Ejiofor tries to sing ""Be Prepared,"" bless him, while James Earl Jones and Mufasa officially become one light.
