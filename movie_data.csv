978295290,Kyle S,Just not the same. Dont waste your time watch the disney classic instead.,2.5,2019-10-02T15:09:44.953Z
978295251,guillermo r,Wish I had not seen this. ,1.5,2019-10-02T14:31:05.427Z
978295118,Johnny N,"The movie's unnecessary need to be true to its source material forces the audience to make that exact comparison, even if it's subconsciously. It's just like the original... except not as good... especially the songs.   ",3.0,2019-10-02T12:15:32.895Z
950916199,,"The Lion King is a 2019 American musical film directed and produced by Jon Favreau. The colour and lighting seemed off in the first half, during which I found it difficult to focus. The animation and narrative did pick up during the second half, but there seemed something lacking and not quite right with the overall production. ",2.5,2019-10-02T11:29:49.356Z
932852458,Thomas B,Great animation/live action. Loved it.,4.0,2019-10-02T02:10:10.401Z
260310611,,"Loved the movie, but I didn't like beyonce's singing unfortunately. Wish they would have stuck to a simpler melody for the iconic song. ",3.5,2019-10-02T00:23:15.921Z
978294511,Andrew S,Visually stunning with opportunities for all the nostalgic feels. Only because the original is so classic does this have value though.,3.5,2019-10-02T00:20:16.023Z
972631439,Gadiel L,Too short for a live action movie ,2.0,2019-10-01T21:08:06.405Z
978294269,Andrew L,"The story is pretty much the same as the classic Disney animated films; only Mufasa's line have changed, and only slightly.

The child Nala is great, while adult Nala is painfully bad. While kid Simba is painful, and adult Simba was surprisingly enjoyable. (Why couldn't Matthew Broderick, or Whoopie reprise their roles? Because James Earl Jones was great.)

The T+P new combo works and I actually really enjoyed the new Scar as he now seems like an actual villain. Sarabi gets lines and feels like a character instead of a cut out, the hyenas are less goofy which isn't 'bad,' but isn't 'good' either.. I'm indifferent to them... but overall..

You've seen this movie before and it isn't as good as Hamlet or the Lion King from your childhood. ",2.0,2019-10-01T20:22:31.105Z
812622099,Zachary C,"Absolutely horrible. I HATED the actor choices. Billy Eichner is a terrible actor that can literally only play one type of character, one that screams and hollers EVERYTHING he says. That's not the Timon I remember as a kid. And changing the lines and songs for a more ""hollywood"" feel was a appalling decision. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.",0.5,2019-10-01T20:20:50.903Z

978292715,Jack B,Please Disney stop your ruining our childhood memories by replacing it with cgi . It's just a greedy moneymaking scam. First Cinderella now this. That's when i loose faith in disney. Two stars for the kind of cool cgi.,2.0,2019-09-30T19:30:44.274Z
978292665,Grizel P,"Very good film, songs bring us a lot of nostalgia but there are some characters who lost their essence in this film and I saw the film in Spanish and the dubbing is pestimus but, for those who saw the 1994 mas film, I recommend watching this movie with the whole family.",3.5,2019-09-30T18:33:29.907Z

976748146,Gleb T,"While this should work on a nostalgic level, remaking vibrant animated film into a soulless cash-grab that lacks any emotion whatsoever (literally and figuratively) was a huge mistake. Not from a monetary point of view, though. ",1.5,2019-09-29T10:46:29.897Z
978290333,Wilson L,"This is a pretty good re-creation of the original movie, with good CG and visual effects, but it was a pretty bland recreation at that. The director could have changed a couple of details to the movie overall.",3.5,2019-09-29T08:38:26.643Z

Mas no quesito visual, musical e nostálgico o filme consegue trazer ótimos momentos que fazer você e seu filho a aproveita-lo. Por isso 2,5 estrelas, se fosse por nota de 1 a 10, acho que 7 tá de bom tamanho.",2.5,2019-09-29T05:17:15.482Z

260323525,,"I thought this movie was well done. They mixed some other Disney movies into there, which I thought was clever. Jon Favreau is a fabulous director. I loved the song adaptations that they did.",4.0,2019-09-28T22:56:04.430Z
978289415,kai m,I think the live action Lion King wasn't horriably bad but it didnt exactly reaching my inner childhood. I was disappointed with song be prepeared sung by scar. I personally believe Jeremy Iron's scar was far better.,3.0,2019-09-28T22:00:08.238Z
978289290,Bea H,"The story itself is a classic, though this is a serious downgrade from the 1994 original. It's borderline offensive, as an animator, to watch CGI animals express no emotion whatsoever for the sake of ""realism."" Cripplingly uninspired. ",1.5,2019-09-28T19:12:34.437Z

978288215,Keara S,A lot of the acting was lackluster and a lot of key songs were cut for sensitive audiences. It strayed a little too far from the original for me in certain areas.,2.0,2019-09-28T05:04:31.615Z
978287943,Araceli Z,"I'm a huge fan of every voice actor in this film, but I felt as if the surplus amount of celebrities was overwhelming. Scenes were also much more dramatized than the original, which took away from it being a children's movie. In my opinion, the emotion in the 1994 version of The Lion King is too iconic to be recreated, but the directors rendition was absolutely phenomenal and respectful to the original. 
",3.0,2019-09-28T01:29:49.332Z
978287721,Ryan C,Definitely paid the right amount of homage. I feel like parts were a bit overdone for the sake of Disney though....  ,3.5,2019-09-27T22:16:51.359Z
978017136,Megan  S,"A cinematic masterpiece is all that directors strive to achieve, unfortunately, most forget the key components of what made those movies so special. In this instance, a stellar cast was set in place as well as an amazing animation team. So what went wrong? The animation, although the setting and locations looked very realistic, the animals, when they spoke, did not. This movie lacked humor character development. The movie relied heavily on the original film, only able to perform well in the box office due to the nostalgia of the Disney Classic.

978286588,Brandon C,"Was great to watch a live action version of my favorite childhood film. Unfortunately the film was an exact copy of the original, which isn't a bad thing but not necessarily a good thing. The cast was great but I felt the movie was being carried on Beyoncé's shoulders. Felt like every time a song came on it had some form of Beyoncé vocals. The duet between Donald Glover's Simba and Beyoncé Nala was my most anticipated part but unfortunately was disappointing due to the fact that Beyoncé's vocals drowned out Simbas which felt more like a Nala solo and less of a duet. Other than that great CGI, and the rest of the cast was great. Really liked the new scar. ",2.5,2019-09-27T05:41:48.963Z

794297796,Nathan B,"I think Disney's latest remakes of Aladdin and the Lion King are two different remake approaches that were done very well. (I loved them both!) Minus one of my favorite songs staring Pumba... 'Are you aching for some bacon?' Lion King is very much a to the script remake of the original, while Aladdin had some story changes and plot deepenings that were also very enjoyable.  The remake followed the script Verbatim, except where animals would have to do things beyond the realm of 'realism' (No pigs wearing grass skirts doing the hula) Dont understand how these 'pro' tomatometer ratings are so off, the Audience score is always the way to go...

977821270,Ogr G,"While I was impressed by the level of effects used to create this remake, I couldn't help but think it was another unnecessary film from Disney. As I understand it, the budget for this film was about $250 million, the original animated film was $45 million. Disney could of made five new, original animated features with that cash. And to be honest, that makes me feel a little bit sad.

Back to the film though, the story hits all the beats from the original, Scars betrayal of his brother, Simba growing up with Timon and Pumba, his eventual return. The songs are fun and again, the effects are very good. I honestly forgot at thimes that this is a CGI movie. It'll easily entertain the kids, but to be honest, I'd put the original on and give them some of the old Disney magic and imagination (that they nicked from Osamu Tezuka and Kimba, the White Lion, oooo!).",2.0,2019-09-23T13:58:12.243Z

978277564,Ben C,"This movie should never ever have been made. Whoever watches this and likes mor than the first one, you should be chucked off rotten tomatoes forever. Walt Disney would be turning in his grave right now because he wouldn't want the original cartoon to be changed like that. Nalas voice sounded like an old lady, pumba wasn't a very good warthog he looked like a farm pig with tusks glued on his face, Timone looked like the last meerkat left in the pet shop that no one wanted. Rafiki, now don't get me started on that blue arsed baboon. Zazu looked like a manky old bird, Rowan Atkinson never have taken the role no matter how poor he is unless the Simba role was offered to him.
Even though the music was so poor the acting was worse. Simba couldn't sing, Nala or should I say Beyoncé has lost her voice. The poorest ever, it would never hold a candle to the original 1994 version. If I could give zero stars I would so be thankful with half. This should never have been remade. They ruined it just like hey did to Aladdin and don't get me started on jungle book. Please don't mess up Mulan I'm begging you please don't. It is the worst film of the year.

The animals look to realistic, they are thin, angry looking, colorless slabs of no emotion. Not to mention the script was not change one bit its as if Disney has reached an all time low which it has. don't waste your money to buy this once it comes out on dvd, you'd have more fun watching the Playmobil Movie.",0.5,2019-09-22T02:41:20.560Z

Timon and Pumba however, were redone in a fresh way staying true to the beloved characters but bringing new laughs. The hyena's also deserve some props for bringing a fresh spin on the original characters. These characters along with the graphics are the reason that I am giving this three stars instead of 2.

978254498,Ashleigh P,"The CGI is breathtaking. And the music, especially the new songs, are awesome! I like how there was a much greater variety of background species than we saw in the original, and it seems that Disney has shifted the hyena society this time around so that is governed by a female. This is awesome...because hyenas are a matriarchal, female-dominated species in real life! Despite this, it seems the (supposed) inbreeding of Simba and Nala is something Disney has yet to set straight but I suppose that might be really difficult/pointless to do as so much of the storyline revolves around that romance and so many people seem to overlook this glitch. Scar appeared to be much darker, with clearer motivations, than in the original. I'm not sure if it's just me but he also comes across as more blatantly sociopathic.

However, this is a very nostalgic movie for many people, and for that reason alone I doubt it'll live up to its reputation.",4.5,2019-09-18T20:31:16.377Z

978119638,Shaan S,"A basic remake of the 1994 original that feels hollow in almost every way. Disney needs to understand that just because they remake a film that has appealed to us for years, it doesn't mean it helms the true emotion in what made the original amazing. Don't think that is the case? The 1994 original film struck us by the heart with its dazzling animation, great soundtrack and memorable moments. This 2019 remake was a legitimate copy and paste of the original (with a few new lines of dialgoue thrown in). Add in some mediocre CGI at times and you have the recipe for a terrible film. It's souless yet filled with nostalgia as it appeals to us who have watched the original in the time it came out. Do people like it? Of course, as its box office performance can attest to that. Do they need to see it? No. They would be better off enjoying the original and its true sentiments.

I would too, ordinarily, but I was quite entertained and enthralled by Disney's remake of this classic. For one thing, the story material itself is so strong that any lack of originality in the story is actually welcome! With Hollywood's never ending obsession with SJW politics and inserting sexuality and profanity for it's own sake it is really nice that Jon Favreau decided NOT to ""update or improve"" the story! Also, having the great James Earl Jones return as Mustafa was a great choice. He, like his character has a very regal quality and timbre to his voice that is, for this roll, absolute perfection. (Although as a big Star Wars geek, I remember turning to my wife during his first encounter with Scar and asking snarkily why he just doesn't Force choke him!) Dominall Gleeson and Beyonce are also wonderful and Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Scar is as magnificently conniving and chillingly evil as one could expect. The movie is visually stunning and should look even more breathtakingly beautiful when it ones out on Disney+ with a good HDR 4K television.

If you're going to remake a classic movie, you have to give it something different, something that makes us feel like it was worth doing, and because the 1994 original was essentially a perfect movie to begin with, this remake just seemed kind of pointless.

956915141,Guy S,"Do you remember The Polar Express with Tom Hanks voicing a conductor on a fantasy train?  Do you remember why the movie flopped?  One reason was that the animation was too life-like.  Humans don't like animations to look too real because it gives us the creeps.
Lion King 2019 fails in many ways and unfortunately its greatest achievement, the near-to-life rendering of the characters is also one of its biggest downfalls.  Having an almost real animal talk and show human emotions just looks wrong.  In the original animated movie, because of relatively simple animation, the audience could suspend their disbelief and could accept the personification, but the 2019 movie is just plain creepy.  It would be like remaking the original Mickey Mouse movies using a real mouse.

Moving on, I have to ask the question ""Why was the movie made?"" The original was tight, fast paced and above all it was funny.  The interplay between Timon and Pumba is legendary. In the 2019 version, not so much. It is as if Disney wanted to explain the jokes of the original, and those that they couldn't explain they just left out.  One of my favourite lines from Timon was when they introduced Simba to their diet.  ""Let's rustle up some grub."" (digs in a log) ""Aha! a grub!"".   Short, sharp and funny.  In 2019 the line is missing.  Instead the forest animals point out the different types of grubs. The Lion King just went from comedy to documentary.

My kids grew up on the Lion King (on VHS), so much so that I knew the first 10 minutes of script out of my head. They loved the animation, I loved the jokes.  I am interested to see who this 2019 version was aimed at.

Sorry Disney.  Well done on the real life animation, but if you want to make dark Shakespearian movies, please don't rehash an old favourite.  ",1.5,2019-09-09T07:56:30.747Z

On top of that the saturation in this film is pretty low, giving it a dull and boring look that is nowhere near as gorgeous as The Jungle Book remake. A remake is supposed to add and fix things that need fixing in the original, be different and stand out on it's own but this just took away. Now I am not saying that it should be like the Little Mermaid Remake from 2018 or like the maleficent movie, but I am saying that when you are going to remake a beloved classic that we have already seen before, add more heart and depth into the characters (especially when all the characters are emotionless cgi animals). They even make the Mufasa Death scene somehow funny and it sound bad to say but it was probably the most funny part of the whole entire film. It was funny because of the bad CGI in that specific scene, weird directing, camera movements and voice acting and because there is absolutely no depth or weight in that scene. I could go on but I will just stop ranting and finish this with one message; People, for Pete's sake, stop giving Disney YOUR money from YOUR pocket every time they make a remake (more like a cash grab then an actual remake).",1.5,2019-09-08T20:34:15.173Z

978037480,Ido D,"""The Lion King"" was a very problematic film, even in its 1994 cartoon. Fascist perceptions of power adoration, conservative mortality, patriarchal nurturing, focusing on the world of males - all did not stop him from becoming one of Disney Studios' favorite works.
Now, in his photo-realistic version, another problem emerged: not only could the images seem cruel and direct to the young audience, but the human dimension that accompanied the savannah animals in the original film was gone. Think of a pumba that is nothing more than a talking warthog, with no real personality, in Seth Rogen's vital speech that only highlights the limited scope of the photo-realistic facial expressions.
The ""Lion King"" model of 2019 is nothing more than an impressive technological vision. And yes, another way to enrich the cashier of Disney Studios. Why think of something new, if you can just do a cover version of the old one? None of the new releases Disney has created so far will become a classic that will accompany children and their parents into the future. Maximum, in 25 years they will produce a new film that will use future technology. Maybe by then they will also be able to engineer emotion.
One cannot help but be impressed by the technological achievements of ""The Lion King,"" and in this respect director John Favreau transcends the visuals offered by his previous Disney adaptation, ""The Jungle Book"" (2016). At the same time, it is precisely the realistic images that are damaging to what worked well in the previous film - the songs. Digital animals look very unconvincing as they begin to sing and move in rhythm, and if ""The Jungle Book"" Favreau gave up all but one of the songs - it seemed possible and desirable here too. ""The Hakone Hookah"" would have worked better as a whistle in the background, and not like the lumbering and magic processing of the current version, which evokes any trace of the animation's original and expressive possibilities. It is enough to see the differences between the two versions to understand.
The film's technological achievements do indeed make us feel like we're in a real jungle. But digital breakthrough enthusiasm does not come at the expense of emotion and soul. This is more of a rehearsal than an attempt to recreate the film (as Julie Taimor did in her successful stage-musical adaptation). Another victim is Zazu, the goofy chicken (Light Knight host John Oliver), who has trouble delivering comic merchandise with a limited range of expressions stemming from realistic animation. At least flying is successful.
The main question that arises in view of ""The Lion King"" is: Why, exactly? After all, it's not exactly a remake, nor an adaptation that offers a reinterpretation of the movie, which was Disney's first based on an original story. The feeling that accompanies us throughout the watching is of blatant exploitation. This is a film that does not come to resume but to squeeze. Its purpose is not to breathe life (something the original movie doesn't need anyway), but to declare: ""Look at me!"" The lions, hyenas, warthog, and Suricata are therefore more reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein's creature than real animals.",3.5,2019-09-07T20:40:40.513Z

With modern film technology and advanced computer graphics this movie per it's budget should have been much better than it is. The big scenes compared to the traditional animation are lackluster and not so dynamic, and the musical numbers are sadly dialed way back and lack the enthusiasm of the previous voices.

When Nala has been chasing pumba and found out that Simba has been ""ALIVE"" for all this time, 

In the 94's version: there's chock, there's mourning, there's some kind of enthusiasm in the movie.
the 2019's version regarding that scene is more ""Meh, ok, you're alive and that's kind of it..."" 

It's so bad and I'm sorry that Disney couldn't direct a movie director in the same path as they did before ... worse movie ever!

Another thing about it is that, I get that they want to make it look as real as possible with this remake but you can't feel the characters, everyone looks the same if they are either happy or mourning for someones death .. there's no feeling to the movie, editing and removing scenes (when nala and sima roll around from the hill and down, it doesn't exist ...!!) ...

The cast has no enthusiasm in this movie, just hire the old cast or use the voices of the old cast and shoot it that way instead .. it's so emotionless so you don't feel for the movie anymore .. a complete waste of money! Worst movie ever!",0.5,2019-09-06T18:15:30.006Z

This remake brings its own the heart, energy, soul, and emotions of the realism of wildlife in Africa with the same story we know and love. Something we all take for granted, that needs to be appreciated in this film as 1000s of species are going extinct every year. That's the circle of life Jon Favreau wanted us to really think about while watching the remake. Real animals are a part of our lives, in the animal kingdom they too have stories to tell. That they also can in body human souls, emotions, grief, heart, tragedy, and triumph even if we can't see it the same way.

You just watch at pseudo-realistic animals, which can't show us real emotions cause they are an animals. When you don't look at the screen and hear voice-actors, you can compare pictures from the original movie and remake in your mind and it works, but if you look at the screen there is dissonance- dools without any emotion and people behind the scene, who try to put some humanity in picture and it looks very weird. Artificially strached useless scenes, like the scene with mouse at the beginning, which provided just to show us how good the modern technologies and CGI and where budget money have been provided. So, according to all this fact i can make a conclusion that film was maded only for getting money from generation who has grew up on Disney's original The Lion King story.

978226318,Dean D,"As a person who walked into The Lion King 2019, with no past baggage or childhood nostalgia, I'd say this was quite a pleasant experience.

Let's go over the pros -for starters, this film is visually incredible,no doubt about it. There are legitimate moments where I would believe that these are real animals in the wild; they look,act and sound like their realistic counterparts. It's a beautiful movie to watch.

The humor,when it's there,is incredible. I am,of course, referring to Timon and Pumba. I have no idea how they performed in the original,but I'm sold on a Lion King 1.5 sequel. They share genuine banter, which really lighten the tone of the film.

In terms of negatives, you've probably already heard,but the film is pretty bland. The lions have no real emotion, nor are they allowed to,cause it would be hard to animate. In that sense,this comes off as a nature documentary, with A-list actors performing mediocre dubs. I don't even blame the actors,it's just that since the animation is so real, the emotions couldn't be. Speaking of which, there's also a weird disconnect between scenes that are clearly meant to be brutal (the stampede, the final fight),but are toned down to PG13 . It takes you slightly off rhythm, because you want it to be real,but you know Disney won't show you the blood and gore.

All in all, I'd say this film works best as a chapter in a photorealism course for budding visual effects artists. I enjoyed it (having nothing to compare to), but if anything, it's gotten me excited to see the original,as well as the Broadway play. I know there's better versions out there, so I'm comfortable not thinking too much about this one.",4.0,2019-09-02T19:43:09.475Z

(I would've just watched Lion King (original) if it was basically going to be the same dialect. ) Also the voices could have been better. (Maybe not the voices, but the voice directing) The characters sound as though they just went through the script once and the director just went with the first take. And the Simba (kid VO) just seemed like he was trying to hard to sound like Simba and wasn't trying to act like him.(He had a good voice I just think the director could have helped him understand Simba's character a bit more so his voice would be convincing to the audience).

The animation is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Seriously, its an achievement in itself.  And seeing the animals express themselves with physical body language hit me harder than the animated version.

And yet its true what you've heard - the photorealism does take away much of the energy and magic that was present in the animated version.  The animals can't emote much, and many, if not all, of the musical sequences fall flat.

Scar as a whole is terrible - they made an artistic choice to portray him as somewhat mangy and sickly looking, which does not make for an intimidating villain.  And his iconic ""Be Prepared"" sequence is only memorable for how flat and terrible it was.

If you're interested in seeing an achievement in animation technology, give this a shot, but otherwise I can't recommend it.  The original is infinitely better, and this version is more of an experimental experience than a true classic.",3.5,2019-08-31T23:32:57.236Z

The thing I'm having the most difficulty with is the voice acting. Compared to Jeremy Irons' performance as Scar in the original, Ejiofor's just seemed a little lackluster in contrast. Sometimes it just felt like the overall voice acting lacked enthusiasm. Still an overall good film, but just a little lacking compared to the original.",3.0,2019-08-29T08:22:33.748Z

976704669,Kirollos N,"The Lion King is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of The Jungle Book 2016, screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and starring Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, Beyoncé Knowles and James Earl Jones once again as Mufasa.

The Lion King is Disney's 3rd Live-Action remake this year. And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.

The original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it ""Live-Action"", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.
I was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!

The Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.

The movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!

The casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!

The movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.

The Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!

I'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!

978212416,Bubbas V,"The Lion King is Disney latest and the most anticipated live-action remake of the year! While it can take pride in its graphics and looks, the film overall loses me within several things that are crucial to the Lion King.  

  Firstly, the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in the film sounds unnatural and like they were purely reading from a script.  Some of the highlighted talent in the film would have to be Seth Rogen (Pumba), Billy Eicher (Timon), and JD McCary (Young Simba) and the rest of the Hyena trio. James Earl Jones was okay but didn't surprise me at all with his performance. However, the voice of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is exceptionally good. 

  Secondly, the lack of emotions on pretty much every character. One of the many things that the animated '94 film got away with was the emotions. It was animated so biology never really played a factor. Due to the realism of the film, the dance sequences/songs, and many of the character development scenes felt flat and bland. While I enjoyed the dance sequences it just felt bland at the same time. Specifically the I Can't-Wait to be King scene fell far down due to realism.  I was seriously and mentally preparing myself for the death of Mufasa and sadly while it was still sad and the same besides one iconic shot being change, the entire sequence felt emotionless and nearly didn't affect as much as it did back in 1994. 

  In conclusion, I enjoyed The Lion King for what it was. It was a bland re-telling of the beloved classic. While I loved some changes added to Nala's character and the epic fight sequence, the film overall fell flat for me.

883901140,Xavier P,"😁I just saw the Lion King and I have to say.........
I was bored out of my mind. It's rant time:

😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it's animals in this movie.

😡However, I've got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.
.
1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that's the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. 

2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying ""Is that a challenge?!"". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.

1+2=3) With one and two combined, it's just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba's pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.

4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. 

What do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC's animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character's emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. 

The battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were ""protected"" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...

5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. 
Ok, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. 

The movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better.

The voice actors did a good job but not great. The originals did a much better job of selling their personalities as animals where this version failed to suspend the disbelief. Many of the moments felt like a person singing the songs rather than the actual characters. It also seemed like they changed each song slightly to fit the voice actors strengths rather than casting someone that could pull off the original ensembles. Overall it was a good watch because it was just visually breathtaking, but as whole this really falls flat considering the high hopes and expectations set for such a classic and nostalgic movie.

978211654,Jesse P,"This movie was not great.  It was not even okay.  It was a complete and utter cash grab of a film.  My girlfriend and I left shortly after the gorge scene because we could not stand this film.  

My single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.

The significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact — scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. 

Upon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.
 
The film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.

978207266,Mahendra C,"The Lion King is a 2019 live-action remake of 1994's animated movie of the same name.
It is directed by Jon Favreau, who previously directed Disney's The Jungle Book. It uses
the photorealistic computer-animation technique to create animals. The 1994's version is
one of the best movies of all time. So does this movie lives up to all hype? Definitely.
All animals look so realistic that you can't differentiate between them and those in
National Geographic's documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is
one of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to
show expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,
which will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological
authenticity.
It would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994's version as
childhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always
be better than the later one.
As an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their
bonding, Mufasa's philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can
easily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father's
paw, the scene is literally heart touching.
Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both
characters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy ""Hakuna Matata""
which was opposite of Mufasa's Philosophy.
There is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and
perfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.",4.0,2019-08-24T13:31:42.221Z

NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop .

Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

This was my favorite animated film in the 90s and I watched it almost every single day of my childhood, so watching it come to life was simply magical. I guess some people were not pleased that it is almost exactly like the original, but that's what I loved about it. It made me nostalgic and so, so happy. The imagery throughout was so beautiful as well. My only real critique is that I thought a few of the voices didn't seem like the right fit, like Nala's, which didn't sound at all like the soft, sweet original voice, for example, and a couple of others. I also felt like some scenes were rushed or over too fast, but overall, this movie is a win for me. Love this movie now and forever.",4.0,2019-08-20T23:51:22.290Z

Pretty much a scene-by-scene replica of the original, which makes it palatable for all ages because the original was good, but also feels uninspired and ""cheap."" The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you've read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It's fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy ""Come-ons!"" and ""Let's do this!"" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce's character literally yells ""Lions, Attack!""  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala. It felt so wrong, out of place and obnoxious.

977719088,Mani P,"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.

The film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.

The story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.

The voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.

The characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.

The animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.

The colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.

The soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyoncé and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyoncé's song Spirit.

The emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.

The film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.

Over all I give it a 
1/10 - would never recommend

But unfortunately there's some not so great things with this movie. A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion.

I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.  On the minus column I think the CGI of the lions faces was subpar, really didn't feel any emotion there.  Zazu as well... hard to watch the way that bird was made, a bit freaky.

With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars ""Be Prepared"" song.

978199037,anonymous  s,"okay, first of all, I would like to say somethings that need to be said about the critics that aren't giving it fair reviews.
First, the reason why games like call of duty and FIFA get high reviews are that a lot of critics are not allowed to make a direct compare to others in a series you can make small parts saying like the characters cannot show emotion like the cartoon but you cannot flat out say the first film better therefor this film was bad.
now on to my review 
_________________________________________________
due to them trying to be realistic it did affect some parts of the movie mostly singing and showing emotion what I mean by this is the singing isn't as clean as you would think the characters sound more like Les Mis where they are more talking through the music and more noise from background fx I don't think many people would like to hear big splash sounds after every step in a song if they are in water oddly it didn't happen in every song just a few 
now with how the characters show emotion oddly, they didn't do a bad job I would say but  some characters have the blank face though the whole movie. They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.
Shouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it 
I would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say

The voice acting was bland, dry, and did not make up for the lack of emotion realistic characters needed. I would take the original voice acting, put it over top since its almost scene for scene, and cut out the unnecessary bits (Like Scar basically becoming an incel because Sarabi chose Mufasa over him) And you would have a perfect, photo-realistic carbon copy.

	Initial Reaction: How is this going to be different than the cartoon version?
	Main Characters
	Simba, Nala: Two lions voiced by Donald Glover and Beyonce
	TImon, Pumbaa: A meerkat/warthog combo voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen

	Plot Summary (for those who didn't see the animated film)
	Lions rule the land where the movie takes place.  The king and queen just brought in their newest baby, Simba.
	But their brother (or brother in law),Scar (with a name like that, how can he NOT be evil?), schemes to get the throne.  Using the help of the hyenas, he gets the kign killed and Simba ousted out of the kingdom.
	But the lion cub gets some help from a warthog and a meerkat, then the spirit of his dead father, then his ""friend"", Nala.

SCORING
	Main Characters
	The main characters most of us know and love are here and they are just as good and we remember them.  SCORE: 9

	Supporting Cast
	They give Nala a bit more personality because, well, she's the leading lady.  Still, we get some good moments from a baboon, a bird and the hyenas themselves.  SCORE: 8

	Plot
	The plot is easy to follow, and it has a few nice twists.  But they add a few new scenes that felt more like padding.  SCORE: 6

	Originality
	This particular Disney remake does the least changes to the animated version – which makes me wonder why make the live action in the first place (other than to show off some impressive CGI.  SCORE: 3

	Violence Factor
	There's a lot of fights between lions and hyenas (I thought I was watching a nature documentary during those fights).  But the fights do get a tiring.  SCORE: 7

	Other Moral Issues
	This film does a great job of showing how to take responsibility for your actions and how to overcome obstacles and situations.  But it does go overboard with the girl empowerment bit.  SCORE: 8

	Final Score (out of 60): 41		% Score: 68.33%
	It's a good film – if you haven't seen the animated version.  But it doesn't do much to make it stand apart from that version. 	",3.5,2019-08-13T19:49:16.624Z

788075726,Jack W,"Found this computer-generated remake to be an entertaining on the whole with a few caveats.

The movie looks so amazing and photo-realistic. The background in particular is really impressive, I'm surprised this film had only one real setting shot. You really can't tell the difference between this landscape and the real world. Director John Favreau (Iron Man; Jungle Book) has some interesting shots in this. At times, the movie feels like a nature documentary.

Plotwise, this is probably the least ambitious of the recent Disney remakes. Unlike Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which clung to the plot structure of the originals but also added new elements, this one just retells the basic story. Still, I'm not hating it. This isn't the 90's Psycho. It's not word-by-word. What works for me here is that the jokes are almost all new and they work really well.

Cast is decent. All the funny characters jive. Donald Glover as adult Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar do a good job as the hero and villain. However, Beyonce as adult Nala sometimes really comes across as reading off the page without a whole lot of effort.

The background music really sells the scenes, but admittedly Hans Zimmer basically just rehashes the music from the first film.

This contains all the classic songs from the original. However, ""Be Prepared"" has been changed to a half-it's-length spoken word song with reworked lyrics. I know at one point the news was that they were cutting this song. (Either for time or Ejiofor just didn't have the pipes.) I'm guessing this was added back due to the backlash but modified to accomodate either or both of the potential issues just mentioned. I actually would've preferred if they left the song out rather than going with this neutered version, which doesn't quite work.

If you feel that the recent Disney remakes are soulless cashgrabs, this really won't be the one to change your mind. Despite coasting with the story, I personally found this to be engaging.",3.5,2019-08-13T04:16:52.036Z

I felt like I was watching a nature documentary that someone had added a voice over (but not well). It's like the voices didn't really gel with the creatures, and the audio levels never seemed to balance properly (sometimes too loud for the scene, other times too quiet, eg the character would be forefront but sound like they were in the distance, and in the distance but sound like they were beside you).
 
The characters were amazingly realistic....to the point that they were basically emotionless and therefore I didn't feel any connection with them.

Also...I know she's ""queen B"", but Beyonce really needs to learn that, in a duet, there's no lead - both voices need to blend together in unison. Instead, I felt like she was determined for her voice to be the star. In contrast, they made it a humour point when the actual star started riffing, which was clever, but then they were fine to have the supporting cast vocals over-power the lead..?

Lion King II doesn't really improve the position.  It inserts this preachy ""straight line theory"" that shames the grub eaters as oblivious to the idea that everything is connected, While Still Presenting Their World As Paradise.  And making the animal-people ultra realistic only serves to make the idea of eating them even more difficult.

Yes, the emotions aren't displayed as greatly as in the original, but that's a given, and the voice acting and the phenomenal music accompanying the scenes make up for it.

All that computer power couldn't save the bad creative decisions from the director. He was so adamant about photorealism that he didn't stop to think about the lack of expressions the characters had throughout the movie.

I hope they release a remastered sometime in the future, one with actual face animation.

The visuals were incredible. Truly, it was difficult most of the time to tell where real turned into graphics. 

I feel bad even writing this because I do kind of cringe when things not related to a movie are brought in as a measure. That being said, I can't dismiss some of the small quirky moments of the animated film that really made it endearing. 

Whoopi's Mufasa shiver...I don't know how you would replicate it but that changes the whole atmosphere of the Hyenas. Simba getting knocked on the head. Classic moments. 

Simba's return seemed less impactful in this version. Didn't feel the struggle and importance of that decision like in the animated version. 

I didn't care for Donald Glover's rendition of Simba. One of the things about James Earl Jones is that is voice is so clear, he annunciates every syllable, he delivers with a fervent performance, he has power, clarity, and meaning. I didn't feel that with Mr. Glover. Fair comparison to anyone? Not really, but I didn't feel anything for his performance here. I feel really bad for anyone who has to sing opposite Beyonce.

The CGI looks pretty damn good but the fact it is using the look of real animals makes none of the characters show any emotion on their faces when they need it. With that thought, the voice work for those hard emotional scenes wasn't there either, Mufasa's death felt less impact full due to the actors lines not hitting right.
Some scenes were not emphasized on enough while others to much, such as the opening where we follow the little mouse, we dont need to follow it for a whole minute and a half, it adds nothing to the picture. While on the other hand the whole ""Be Prepared"" song number was basically gutted from the film and replaced with the last few lines being ""Talk Sung"" by Scar, another scene taken out, and probably one of the most important, being the scene where Rafiki gives his words of wisdom about learning from the past.

978191492,Distracted _,I think it's a fun and inducing movie and a great remaster if the original Lion King. I like how Disney is remaking their old classics to appeal to the new generation of our audiences. I think they did a good job on the animation and almost all the animals looked realistic. One complaint I do have though is the audio. Disney used the original audio from the first movie which I think is a good choice it's just that Disney didn't remaster the audio. At some points it sounds like the audio was recorded on a $10 microphone rather than the new high-quality mics. The lip-syncing with the animation sometimes doesn't look good. I'm surprised that that happened because Disney is known for their masterful animation and how they try to make their movies as perfect as possible.

There is no question that the special effects look real, as though there are live animals speaking and interacting with each other.  The kids particularly liked the comic routine of Pumba and Timon (yes, especially the farting!), and their various forest friends.  But what struck me about this movie was the extraordinary precision with which it hewed to the plot of its animated predecessor, with characters, scene, and sequence virtually identical (as well as the songs, which is understandable; and, I think, even the dialogue).  I'm going to look out for the extent to which other Disney live-action successors replicate their canonical referents.

I remember in the original there was time dwelling on Simba looking at the body and begging for Mufasa to get up.  Here, he just kinda looks at it, sniffles a bit, and the scene moves on.  Look I'm not saying it needs to be a shot for shot remake, but if you are going to go through the effort of doing the exact same scenes, either do them better, or do them at least as good, don't just rush through them to check off a box.

But at the end of the day, if I ever want to see The Lion King again, I'm going to watch the original.",3.0,2019-08-08T03:22:57.890Z
978190760,Korey P,"I thought it was really stiff. 

The characters lacked emotion. The dialogue was too formal at times. 

The expression in the voice acting didn't match the CGI.

Plus. All of the classic songs were flattened with, ""Glee"" levels of autotune. 

And to add insult to a classic scene. .  the iconic, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" scene, was played out in broad daylight; with Beyonce unleashing unbridled vocal runs over the classic song.  . A hot mess.

An uncanny remake.

My mom fell asleep at one point, my brother fell asleep, and I was about to at some points of the movie. This was at a 3:00 pm showing. Don't get me wrong the effects in this movie were fantastic but it doesn't mean anything if I don't feel anything from seeing it. The theme of the movie was lost by the long transitions from scene to scene by Disney trying to show off their technical skills. Therefore, the feeling and emotion evoked from the faces and surroundings of the original Lion King were completely lost. I gave it a star because the singing from the actors were great, and added half a star because of the background visuals.

978189805,Kai H,"The visuals in this movie are impressive. The photo realism is astounding, but that's not all this movie should've been. The story was a copy and paste of the original, much like a video game remake. The voice acting was subpar at some points. Some of the most influential scenes (Mufasas death, Scars musical number, Hakuna Matata) were dull and lifeless BECAUSE of the photo realism. The characters can't emote properly so some of the body movements are exaggerated, but then it gives the characters an uncanny valley vibe. One of the best Disney villain songs in my opinion was completely scraped and only had a hint of the original song towards the very end, but even then it wasn't there. Because this is photorealistic, there's no creativity. What should've been inspiration, was just there to be a template to animate over. The lack of facial expressions kills this whole movie. When Simba sees his father dead on the gorge floor in the original, he is so expressive and it makes you feel what Simba is feeling in that moment. In the remake, all of that emotion is lost. No expression, no emotion. If they were making this for a bunch of lions, I'm sure they'd be thankful for the accuracy, but the movie isn't for LIONS it's for HUMANS. Humans rely on facial emotion to properly understand what's happening. Animals (especially felines) don't. They rely on body language. But a lot of people can't read animals. That's why cats are seen as aloof and uncaring. Their owners can't read them. If people aren't able to read real life animals, how are they supposed to read the body language of an imitated animal? So many influential scenes were removed and so many tedious and useless characters were added (ie the animals in the jungle) all for the sake of a joke or a sixty second song. The scene with Mufasas ghost in the clouds was barely recognizable for me in theaters because all I saw was a bunch of clouds with the occasional lightning. When you take one of the worlds most known films and attempt a remake, you should improve on it. Don't try to change the formula. Leave some realistic elements in, but don't try to make it look like I just spent twenty bucks on a movie ticket to watch a National Geographic documentary. This movie was lifeless and a copy paste, but with better graphics. ",0.5,2019-08-07T07:49:06.672Z

Lions with facial expressions make it very appealing to the younger audience. However, this movie is life changing and a huge leap in the movie industry. Of course, they won't give a virtually real looking lion eyebrows that leave their face. It is up to the audience to listen and experience in order to get a feel for what this movie is expressing. Yes, that means use your own imagination. The Lion King has opened so many doors and it's hard to think of an new animated movie that could possible beat this one. Everything was fantastic. A lot of critics will say that they left out important messages that the original movie inputted.

This might be sacrilege, but I never saw the original, so I can't compare.

The visuals were really outstanding and mesmerizing.  There were times I struggled to tell if it was real or not.  

In terms of the actors, I thought Seth Rogan was pretty strong.  Beyonce was my second favorite.  Donald Glover (as Simba) was OK but didn't really stand out to me.

Overall I enjoyed it.

The cgi visually was amazing, it really felt like you were watching a documentary.That being said i felt the realism was what let the film down, missing the facial expressions and emotions from the original.

The music of course is what made the lion king great ! But again you can't not compare it to the original which of course is better .

Apparently there was 30 minutes more added to this remake which I rarely noticed when watching the film except for when they threw in a bit of Beyoncé just to fit in her new song .

Overall kids that are just being introduced to Disney will love it and the adults going with them will enjoy the nostalgia factor that made them love the original.

 The voice actors did their jobs , withh Seth Rogen and Beyonce standing out amongst the cast, and The Neptunes & Elton John did spectacular remixes to a soundtrack that never knew it needed a touch up.
There was a comic book adaptation of this that enjoyed reading above all retellings of this story , but Favreau's reboot of this stroy is in a class of it's own by sheer visual effects alone so much so that all interpretations of this film that came before don't even deserve to be put in comparison.

260014011,,"I don't understand why they took out so many good things about the original movie. That plus, rushed dialouge, (felt like they (even James Earl Jones!) were reading a script for some of the old good dialouge) too loud music during a couple major dialouge scenes, way too much screen time for the mouse Scar was planning to eat and Simba's hair floating to Rafiki. And how did he know it was Simba's? It had touched water, a giraffe's tongue and dirt; I don't know how it would have still held Simba's scent. And it's just a piece of hair, not his hair all over the grass and flowers like in the original. How did he know who it was just by a look? Nala also recognized Simba way too fast! And though the lions were real-looking and beautiful, it took away from the emotion. Young Simba's crying and yet I see no tears and see no sadness on his face, so it took away from some of the emotional scenes. Minor note but Mufasa roared on the cliff scene. I preferred the original where his scream and roar was combined when Scar clawed him. It was also hard to tell the difference between Sarabi and Nala. A couple minor changes, a couple added lines to Scar and Timon and Pumbaa were good, but nothing spectacular. I couldn't see Mufasa in the sky. With all the special effects, I thought that would have been at least like the original, maybe better. Rafiki calls his stick his old friend, yet we never saw it in the beginning. He wasn't funny and silly, and he kept speaking in a different language which was confusing and not needed. And they took out him hitting Simba on the head! That was needed for Simba to change his mind and had a great moral lesson! And last but not least, they cut Be Prepared, one of the best songs ever made by Disney!! I understand why they did because the original is condescending to the hyena pack and they were a lot creepier and more aggressive in this version. But they could have done the song so much better. They shouldn't have even bothered making it if they were gonna do it like this. No need. Usually Disney does a great job, (like Aladdin.

Yes, the story is completely recycled from the 1994 original almost shot-for-shot but that wasn't a big problem for me. I would recommend seeing this film if only to witness the stunning CGI on display here. It's genuinely photorealistic -  I might as well had been watching a Nat Geo documentary in that theater. I also have to mention the voice work of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumba. The stars of this movie as far as I'm concerned. Perfect casting. The jokes never fall flat and I found myself truly laughing on more than one occasion. Donald Glover suprisingly delivers an underwhelming performance as adult Simba. Almost emotionless most of the time. I was also glad to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasa once again, always great in his iconic role. However, the pacing of the movie felt a bit off, almost as if it was rushed.

For example you can see the muscle structure in Simba's legs, the hair and facial features in Pumba and the soul in the eyes of Rafiki.  When getting into nitpick territory I would only suggest that Jeremy Irons should have returned in the role of Scar.  That would be the only thing from making this a 5/5.  Many people might complain that the film is just a scene for scene remake of the animated classic, which I'm fine with.

I wish I could see this movie without that advantage. Would it still carry well? Possibly, it's still a strong story, but I feel the real problem is the lack of emotion in the new portrayals, both in the voices as well as the lack of expression in the faces. Even James Earl Jones sounds tired and bored. Also, with songs as popular as these, every nuance sticks out. Kid Simba is basically lacking in emotion entirely both speaking and singing, new Zazu doesn't even ATTEMPT to be fun and interesting, kid Nala sounds like she's reading off her script, or at best maybe had one chance to read it over before delivering lines. Ugh and Timon and Pumba make Hakuna Matata a cringefest (as was Just can't Wait to be King). It really makes me wonder if these are good songs without the influence of the original. I generally enjoy covers when theyre done well, but I can't help but cringe at these attempts.

Every single moment of this movie was several steps below the original to the point where it was frustrating to watch.  It felt like every actor was phoning it in, even James Earl Jones, who was delivering the same lines as he did before, just worse somehow.  This movie was too long and yet felt like everything was rushed down to a high school first time table-read.  The only good thing about this movie by a long shot was John Oliver as Zazu who did a really good job and I enjoyed any moment he was on screen; perfect for the part.

The original animated film is a classic. A cliche story with great music, fun animations, and even brings a tear to your eye. 

However, the live action feel is way too close to reality. The animals look real, and it makes me feel uncomfortable to see them talk, sing and dance. The songs feel like they were cut short, the classic moments feel forced, and while it did pass the time, I cannot say that I enjoyed it.

978033907,Two B,"Without a doubt the best movie Disney has ever made so far. It teaches you about the meaning of life, self awareness, true potential and overcoming your past. A beautiful master piece carefully crafted. And yet, this version fell so short. Why Disney keeps stomping on the things that we love and care about?

The characters were awful, Simaba is more reckless, weak and scary cat than it was before and Nala is more obnoxious, I used to love Nala because she was the anchor of Simba she was that little support and self awareness that Simba needed, now she's more like an obnoxious whip that never stops. 

In this version most of the comic relieves were removed or changed for something else,  this is disheartening because these scenes were part of the core of the movie, I remember when I was a little kid the hyenas made laugh so hard, here they removed most of their scenes so no laugh anymore. 

The music was great though. I still feel goosebumps when listening to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""The circle of life""; beautiful music in deed, and I believe the movie has some of the best songs a movie can have.

When Mufasa died (SPOILER ALERT), I felt NOTHING. 

When Simba roared to become king, I felt NOTHING. 

The film completely lacks the emotional depth of the original, and we're left with little more than a soulless shot-for-shot remake of the animated masterpiece. Granted, the visuals are spectacular, and the CGI is great, but this is that rare occasion where that is a bad thing. The animals look far too real to express any real form of emotion, which was my biggest concern going into this movie. 

The voice cast is solid, with Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) and Billy Eichner (Timon) stealing the show. They were even nice enough to bring back James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa. Unfortunately, that was the only returning member of the original voice cast, which I feel was a mistake. Chiwetel Ejiofor was an AWFUL replacement for Jeremy Irons as Scar, and the way the movie butchers the song ""Be Prepared"" is simply mind-boggling. The rest of the songs are perhaps the highlight of the film, providing you with a rush of nostalgia, most notably in the ""Circle of Life"" opening. To be honest, that may have actually been my favorite scene in the movie.

Nobody wanted a remake of The Lion King, which was already perfect in its original form. The only reason for this movie's existence is to be a quick cash grab, which Disney has gotten in the form of over a billion dollars and counting. For me, I've officially had enough of these cheaply made live-action remakes. Perhaps these films will resonate with this current generation of kids, and that's OK.

978066423,Cece O,"I originally walked into the theater hoping that I'd get a new take on a childhood classic. I had watched the movie many times as a child for it was my brother's favorite movie, and based on how Disney had rewritten the stories for this new age of live-action remakes (such as Maleficent not being as evil, and the side story in Dumbo) I had high hopes and high expectations. However, Disney did NOT meet up to those expectations. 

First off, the voice acting was not good, most notable in Beyonce's work. While I love Queen Bee, I detested her voice acting, and I'm quite sick of actual talented voice actors being replaced by A-List Celebrities just for the star quality to use in promotions to push out the movie and gain more money. Evidently, Disney values quantity over quality (not that I didn't already know this).

For the movie being a complete remake of the original without any new focus or plot-line, I at least expected it to be better, but it wasn't. The song sequences in the original were dull in the movie due to the lack of vibrant colors and stunning animation, and I was not very fond of the singing either. This was a definite complaint in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. There was simply too much riffing for it to be enjoyable (for me at least) and while the singers are talented, I just wasn't into the style of singing compared to Disney's simpler yet powerful music- where the singers shows their prowess in the power of their voice rather than in how much they can riff notes (again, I was mostly annoyed with Beyonce). It turned from a sing-a-long tune to a listen-and-appreciate song, which was not something I wanted from such a staple like 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. 

Most egregious, however, was the fact that they CUT SCAR'S VILLIAN SONG! IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS! WTF!? IT MIGHT NOT BE A 'HELLFIRE', BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD, AND THE ANIMATION SEQUENCE FOR IT IN THE ORIGINAL WAS SO AMAZING WITH THE GREEN TINT AND EVERYTHING, UGH!

The only thing that was an improvement was the comic relief characters Timon and Pumbaa, and I wouldn't mind getting a Lion King 1 1/2, as long as they were just as funny.

I suppose the movie would be good for the new generation that can't compare it to the original (but I'd most certainly never let my little cousins watch this before feasting on the beauty that was 1994's Lion King), but for older viewers like me (lol, I'm only seventeen), DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The original Lion King's on Netflix now, just watch it there.

907803058,Kyle M,"If you could think which Disney classic seems to be more of a masterpiece, taking it further on a majestic scale, ""The Lion King"" would arguably come to mind as the most outstanding animated presentation – with questionable origin, while Jon Favreau's reimagined ""The Jungle Book"" takes the top podium for the live-action medium. The obvious connection between the two films is Favreau's ambition of exploiting the amazing technological effects that brought ""The Jungle Book"" to life, with blended vie for faithfulness that marks his authorship, and ""The Lion King"", being Disney's Renaissance peak, is another nature film with a legendary stance that makes it a perfect challenge to tackle in another reimagining. The remake does not exactly reach the mighty volume but is without a doubt generally beautiful and honorably triumphant.

""The Lion King"", marking the 25th anniversary of the original majesty, is agreeably inferior but nonetheless great from the scenic imagery masking authentic natural wonders as the definite counterpart form of photorealism to the overall soul consisting the musical score and vocal performances. The kinetic energy between the CGI-created environment and the mostly new cast bringing their connected characters to life is what makes the onscreen appearances as perfect embodiments, indicating how utterly faithful Favreau passionately honored without ruining the formulaic greatness. With a lot of iconic aspects that could not be completely revised nor flipped whilst still the same narrative touch in the flow, he still obliged with the current traditional routine of modernizing meanings, differentiating insights and originated intentions that were more pointed out towards the classic with very little to improve. The story is Shakespearean through ""Hamlet"", and Favreau pushed the story closer to its original source material.

However, the film is mostly criticized for being more of a shot-for-shot remake without adding anything new to the whole story. While that may be true unlike how the past remakes enhanced the experience with updated storytelling and opportune positions for character arcs that were not thought of at the time,  and there are only little expansion in the script's subtle heftiness, it is rather proof that the story can still be told under a new aesthetic with the same enjoyment value – like how praiseworthy remakes did when reusing the formula. As the main intention is to honor the story, Favreau explored it dimensionally albeit being at times questionably disruptive in contrast to the original's smoothness, and the effects adds little more depth such as the expressions when emotions are expressed.

One element that pleasantly remains the same between the two is the music with composer Han Zimmer reprising his role in spiritually lifting the story's spirit once again, revitalizing the circle of life. The opening number, presented by the franchise's collaborative performer Lebo M featuring Rafiki theatrical performer Lindiwe Mkhize, gives the film's first impression with an ever-chilling effect as it amplifies the scene – and given the background information shows the faithful lengths that were pursued.

The Broadway-equivalent fine cast has lent their voices to the beloved, memorable characters with matching yet refreshing spirit including the update's more modernized tone. James Earl Jones' return as Mufasa is an awesome touch in revisiting the Pride Lands with the mightily classic guidance. The rest of the cast, becoming part of the challenging retelling, did exceptionally well in their performances, with some proudly matching the original voices as a step further of doing their part in honoring the legacy's initial characterization. The only flaw is not making up for agreeing in shorthand to follow the disruptive flow on very few, noticeable occasions.

Jon Favreau triumphs in successfully tackling the ambitious challenge of remaking a classic, while enforcing photorealism as another masking medium for filmic storytelling and again demonstrating faithful lengths in really connecting to the story while honoring it. He did just that in exploring the circle of life in a way he wanted to tell it, despite being more flawed than his previous jungle expedition that was only groundbreaking and additionally hefty. ""The Lion King"" may not roar as mighty nor in a majestic fashion to the king's royal level, the undemanding remake successfully and perfectly naturally replicated the epic power to bolster the entertainment value in being noted as this year's best live-action remake from the brand, with beauty and honor.

King Louis doesn’t sing when he’s confronting Mogli and the scene is immensely more terrifying and believable. I wasn’t scared of Scar when he “sang” Be Prepared. I didn’t feel whimsical at Can’t Wait to be King. Honestly the best musical segment was Lion Sleeps tonight because it provided some comical relief and built itself naturally. Speaking of poor music choices, Lion King 2019 had the opportunity to truly marry the beloved animated film with the beloved broadway musical and just...didn’t. The available soundtrack even has several songs from the broadway show, yet the film does not use them. Instead of “He Lives in You” we have Beyoncé singing “spirit” over and over. Rather than “Shadowlands”, we have...”Be Our Guest?” The Beauty and the Beast reference was completely out of place and really took away from the scene. Lastly, although the animation is beautifully done, Favreau dug his heels in on the realism. The magnificent color pallet and character design/humanism in the original animated film is replaced with emotionless hyper-realistic animals and sets. No longer the rich and dramatically colorful landscapes and emotive characters, but more of the dry earth tones and expressionless animals. Any wildlife documentary does a better job of highlighting Africa’s immense beauty and diversity. I can understand Favreau’s desire to cater to the nostalgic audience, but it feels, again, like he couldn’t decide what movie he wanted to make. Was it a frame by frame remake or was is a serious toned adaptation with small tributes to the source material? Yes. ",2.0,2019-08-04T04:03:27.835Z

849847327,Andy G,"This is tricky to rate. I heard one person explain it very well ""It's like you're enjoying the movie, but also bored at the same time"". I give it points for the visual technology, for the score, for the cinematography, and some of the acting, but overall there's just a feeling that it's lacking the soul it needs, because they decided to make the animation just a little too realistic, where the animals simply are expressionless, and it hurts the movie.

I don't know why they took that approach. It's been proven before that realistic models/lighting/materials can mesh very well with a slightly more cartoony animation. In fact, some of the best animation I've ever seen has been done that way, and this movie would have been improved if they handled things that way. Take a look at Rocket Raccoon for a relevant recent example of a mostly photorealistic animal that animates properly. Even The Jungle Book handled this better. 

It's still mostly an enjoyable experience, because I mean, it's still the Lion King, but with the obvious comparisons you're going to make, even a decently made movie is still going to feel underwhelming compared to a practically flawless original. So yes, my words may seem at odds with my rating, but overall, this was still a well made movie. It just didn't live up to the bar it needed to hit.",4.5,2019-08-02T07:55:42.300Z

971893883,Micah W,"Man... where do I start with this one... I came into this film hearing both good things about the film from friends and bad things from critics, so I tried to keep an open mind, but this one was really quite a disappointment. While I can tell that a lot of hard work was put into this movie, as a whole, it just failed in so many ways. In case you haven't heard, the new Lion King is very closely followed to that of a shot to shot remake. There are some subtle differences to the film, but nearly all of them are much more for worse than for better. While there are some problems I have with the idea of a shot to shot remake, I wouldn't mind it too much if they had kept the heart of the original intact. However, they didn't and that can be broken down into 2 main reasons. 

(1). The Cinematography. What I'm about to say may not make sense at first, but bear with me. I truly believe that some absolutely amazing work was done in terms of the visual effects for this film. So much time and effort was put in from this department and it shows in its realism (even if it does cross into the uncanny valley occasionally). However, despite this fact, the movie is so visually boring. Sure, the visual effects of the film may look realistic, but that doesn't mean they look good from an artistic perspective. Everything is just so dull looking and anticolorful. Sure it looks like I'm watching a documentary, but it's a documentary that contains flat, boring shots that do nothing to show off the beauty of Africa. If you want visuals like that, go watch Planet Earth. That movie is stunning! Compare the visuals of the remake to that of the animated original. Because the original isn't hindered by its ideology that it has to look as realistic as possible, it has the creative freedom to exaggerate. To do things that you just couldn't without it being animated. One scene, in particular, was that of ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"". In the original, as soon as the music hits, the animation changes and the world becomes gorgeously colorful. The whole scene is Simba and Nala interacting with all the animals in fun and creative ways that make for a joyous time. Contrast to the original and its both of them running around the watering hole trying to hide from Zazu. Nothing special. The problem with the choice of making it look like a documentary is that it adds restrictions to the film that the original could ignore and run wild with! The visual style may look realistic for the most part, but that doesn't mean it looks good.

(2).The performances. I have to first off preface this by stating that I in no way believe that any the actors in this film are bad actors. On the contrary, there is a whole lot of voice-talent in this film! However, what we hear is only half of what we get when it comes to performances in a film like this. That other half of the performances was that of the facial expressions. ESPECIALLY the ones pertaining to any of the lion characters. I know this goes back a little to the previous point I made, but the idea of making this film look hyperrealistic hurt this film in so many ways! Because they decided that these lions need to look and act as realistic as possible, they dumbed down their facial expressions to the point that you can barely tell what any of them are thinking. It merely looked like voices dubbed poorly over nature documentary footage. Imagine seeing an actor sound like they are truly crying and balling as they stare at the lifeless body of their father with eyes that only seem mildly upset. That is what watching this film was like. I could never take any of these performances seriously despite the talent behind these voices. Even James Earl Jones sounded bored in this movie!! The only real exceptions to this in the film were from Timon and Pumba. They were hilarious! They were allowed to be different and the animation used for them allowed the expressiveness in their voice to actually come out and shine. 

There were many other problems I had with the film (i.e. theme removal, incredibly rushed scene pacing, ""Be Prepared"" is shortened to a sloppy mess, and WAY too many riffs from Beyonce and Donald Glover), but these two points were the main ones that stuck out to me.",1.5,2019-08-02T06:19:58.624Z

977945331,Will M,"I truly enjoyed the original Lion King, it deserves all the attention it gets. I was cautious as I entered the theater to see the latest Disney live action remake, although nothing in the film is not entirely computer generated. But I was hopeful, I wanted to enjoy this movie. Directed by Jon Favreau? I love Iron Man, and even the live-action Jungle Book! I will start with the pros. First and foremost, the VFX. This is probably the most photorealistic CGI I have ever seen in any movie ever, and I say that with confidence. I cannot imagine how long it took to animate this film. The casting was pretty good. I thought it was a smart move to hire James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa a second time, because, let us be honest, that guy is irreplaceable! Donald Glover as Simba, Beyoncé as Nala, John Oliver as Zazu, were really good. I think the best voice performance, though, was Seth Rogen as Pumba. Now for the cons. Being a shot for shot remake, you know exactly what is going to happen, when it is going to happen, how it is going to happen, and so forth. The remake of Beauty And The Beast, which I also disliked, was shot for shot as well, but they sprinkled it with a few new songs, new scenes, and some dialogue alterations. The Lion King, on the other hand, the original has more scenes than this. They have shortened this movie by at least twenty minutes. Remember Be Prepared in the original? In this, the song is less than thirty seconds. Also, some of the characters do not have a fraction of the charm as they did in the original. For example, Rafiki is wise, but a bit of a joker in the original. In this, he is just wise. Even Scar is not as intimidating as he was. Another thing, being as photorealistic as it is, the characters cannot make facial expressions. Since the original was a cartoon, they could smile, frown, cry, scream, and gasp. Realistically speaking, a Lion cannot do any of those things. So when they talk, they look like they are simply opening their mouths, and this flaw is sometimes laughable. The biggest flaw, however, is that this movie has absolutely no reason to exist. There is not one thing wrong with the original, so why remake this if there is nothing that can be improved upon?

978181010,Vivienne S,"Boring, uninspirational, and a study in mediocrity. The Lion King was so busy doing what they could that they didn't stop to wonder if they should. This movie is almost monochromatic, except instead of white and black, it's dull brown and green. I almost dozed off multiple times. The animals and scenery look incredibly real, but it meshes oddly with the voice actors. Which is it, Disney? You can't have realistic-looking scenes and talking animals. Oh, wait, but you did anyway-and the end result suffers. The movie is stuck, caught between hyper-realism and obvious, flat voice acting. The stripping of one of the film's best songs (Be Prepared) and complex characters (Scar) is also a cinematic crime. Scar used to be sarcastic and oddly charming as a villain, but after this shaved down version, he's a flat caricature that needs a bath and better conditioner. If photo-realism is the hill Disney wants to die on, I'm certainly not going to watch the Lady and the Tramp remake. Why should I pay to watch another terrible live-action that is forced to rely on nostalgia rather than stand up on its own two feet?

Additionally, I can't see why they got (a very old-sounding) James Earl Jones back to voice Mufasa, but not the original voice actors for Scar, the hyenas, or Zazu: their remake counterparts simply further lost the appeal of what could've been a worthy addition to Disney's CGI lin-up (though Pete's Dragon was equally as unworthy of it's ""update) -- Maleficent, Dumbo, Jungle Book, Aladdin, BATB, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, 101 Dalmatians are brilliant (IMO).",0.5,2019-08-01T04:19:53.521Z

Beyoncé's singing, for instance, is faultless - even with great studio refinement. But having a very out-of-place song of hers upon the determined return of Simba is just cringeworthy.


Nevertheless, for new generations of children, Disney has to adapt its productions to popular trends in order to profit. But count me out. As menacing as Scar was, Disney have faltered in reproducing a story - which, was not even their first original in 1994 (see Kimba/Simba controversy) - and consequently we have to endure all this hype about something extremely underwhelming.",1.5,2019-08-01T01:41:08.638Z

The animals looked absolutely fantastic - if this were a nature show. But, as far as emoting and engaging the audience in the story, it just fails completely. I think it's just a limitation of transitioning from an animated medium to a live action one where anthropomorphizing the animals to express emotions would probably just look weird.

Many of the voice actors I also felt were flat. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, & Beyoncé's performances were just lifeless. Not to mention I could barely hear/make out the majority of John Oliver's dialogue. James Earl Jones was perfect and spot on as usual. The songs were good, not as good as the original imo, but still they weren't too bad. I missed the original ""Be Prepared"" and that Beyoncé song seemed so out of place.

None of the changes made anything better, especially for the music, they tried to hard to make it better and unfortunately you can tell. 
If Disney wants to regurgitate old ideas I would personally appreciate at LEAST replacing original music or script with something better, not worse.

Billy Eichner asTimon is without a doubt the best character in the film, he brings a new side to Timon that probably wouldn't have worked in 94 but is perfect for the character!
(Beyonce's casting made me sceptical at first but she's actually really good as Nala).
The crititcs won't enjoy this film because it doesn't really offer anything new other than the visuals, but that's literally exactly what the audience wants, if you love the original, you'll love this.

I understand you can only do so much with ""live action"". But before someone does a ""live action"" movie with animals I think they should study the animal and how they act. Example: simba roars and the  wildebeest come running down the cliff. The live action had simba standing there saying ""oh no."" An actual cat would have probably layers it's ears down and hunkered down in fear. Kind of what they did in the cartoon. And I'm actually pissed about scar. Scar was shown to be mean, scary and very dark. His voice was very dark and unsettling. Example: in the cartoon mufasa jumps on the cliff, climbs to the top to see scar staring down at him. Mufasa then asks scar to help him and scar proceeds to dig his claws into mufasas arms and in a scary deep clam voice tells mufasa ""long....live...... the king"". In the live action mufasa climbs up to the top of the cliff to find scar. In this scene scar digs his claws into mufasa (just like the original) the in a very high toned voice and yells ""long live the king"". There was no emotion given in this scene and this was THE MOST EMOTIONAL SCENE OF THE MOVIE. This movie was NOT the movie to choose to do a live action. Many things where left out. The emotional was not given, there was no accuracy in this movie in which lions ""actually move"" since they where going for live action. Everything was dull. The symbolism was left out with  Rafiki  And simba. Example:  Rafiki  Hits simba in the head with the stick. Simba asks ""what was that for""  and Rafiki replies ""doesn't matter it was in the past"". There was SO much that they could have done with this film. It was SUCH a disappointment.

I took my two oldest daughters to this today, and we all loved it. The familiar music, the familiar lines and scenes all brought back memories to the classic original, which remains to this day my favorite Disney film. The added humor, and even some hilarious line changes and references to other Disney movies make this adaptation unique enough to not be an exact clone of the original, but with the same characters, plot and story that we've all come to love.

There is some elements of scare for smaller children as the CGI does make the animals look real, but the humor, fun and playful nature of characters like Timon and Pumba largely make up for the occasional scare.

And yes, I LOVED the new version of ""Be Prepared"", because the animated version had hundreds of Hyenas lined up like a Nazi Germany parade, and this film was much more lifelike in its portrayal of the hyenas.

So much that it was top of my list to see Disney live show when at WDW and see kiddo perform in kid show locally.  After months of soundtrack still never tire of music or story.

Had such high hopes but did not like darker style of story or that some scenes adjusted because it changed the story too much.  Thank goodness for James Earl Jones who is the only Mufasa!  Some decent or mediocre performances and some downright awful.  Almost left theatre, but felt committed to see it through.  My 11 year old who also LOVES lion king asked 3x to go home.

978179552,Bianca R,"-First few minutes of the intro gave me shills, it was great. A sense of community was present at first that slowly dissipated. The story became more self-centered as it went on.  
-Gorgeous character and landscape visuals except the stars 
-Great recorded animal behaviors 
-Quick, bland and inadequate script writing (with a few good jokes once in a while) 
-Young Simba is a small miscast(The character itself is not courageous, not fooled, but foolish from the get go) the high-pitch voice wasn't very soothing)
-Cut shorter than the previous version 
-Lack of depth
-Wisdom filled messages covered up by hurried script writing once again 
-Failure to represent the ""normal distribution"" that shapes a society. Of course it's always good vs evil with Disney. Truth is, it is getting old and real life is much more nuanced. The encouragement of said stereotypes aren't very educational, especially when there are no facts or reasons built around to explain a wrongdoer's actions, leaving the impression that it is okay to forget to have empathy and feel self-righteous. Sure Scar can be petty, lie and cruel in his intentions. Shouldn't the hero ask himself a bit more questions as to why? Children aren't born that way, that's for sure... 
-The villain or opponent is showed as less intelligent and sly. He doesn't truly need to manipulate Simba all that much since the cub just follows him along. Didn't he have a warning from Moufassa or has the King too much on his mind to warn the son he so dearly cares for? Doesn't make sense. 
-Some people will start to question the difference between courage, risk and poor judgement. 
-Tasteful soundtrack 
---This is an on-the-side comment---
It would be extraordinary if Disney stopped making super-hero movies all while re-creating or (re-stashing) their traditional masterpieces, even if they generate big bucks. They are a multi-billion dollar company and are looking like they run on greed more than dreams now a days. It would be extraordinary if they worked towards more original content. Now is not the time for distractions, but to make people more self and world-aware. Even a message promoting a good charity at the end would have been an interesting to do.

First, Beyonce should never have been cast for this.  Her signing is good (usually), but her voice overs and her song in the movie were just flat terrible!  Then there was hakuna matata......it was just so flat and boring.  The original is so fun and engaging.  This version was none of that.  And then there was the rest of the dialog of the actors.

855810299,Norman P,"The Lion King (2019)

A little late with this review, but watched it in the cinemas about a week ago.

Lion King has always be my all time favourite Disney cartoon, despite whatever people may say about it regarding the lack of originality of it all. So when news of the remake came out, I was doubtful of the quality of it, as most remakes usually fall flat on its face.

And this was no different. Apart from the amazingly life-like CGI and the sporadic nostalgia-evoking moments, the whole remake fell way short of the original animation. Voice actors were not picked properly, feeling like they were cast merely for their name.

Rafiki's role felt sidelined, without much emphasis on his impact on Simba's decisions and change of heart. Despite having a heavyweight cast of musicians, the songs felt flat and uninspired, emotionless. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was butchered, and sung in broad daylight.

Overall, it was disappointing, but not the worst Disney remake.

While it is obvious that a lot of money and effort was put into the photo-realistic animation, the lack of expressiveness really hurts it in places. The audience at my theater straight up laughed at the scene when Simba yelled ""no!"" with a totally blank expression as Mufasa was plunging to his death. When the movie flashes back to that scene near the end, they laughed AGAIN. One of the most notoriously crushing scenes in movie history, completely robbed of its impact by a production that was so committed to realism that they refused to match the emotion of the voice acting with the facial expressions of its characters.

There was so little emotion in the most emotional scene. That sentiment was consistent throughout the movie in most of the dramatic scenes, and heck some of the more comedic scenes too. I'm not angry, ""just disappointed"". Its a passable copy, and i will admit that seeing some of the scenes in that beautiful CGI moved me in a new nostalgic way,( the opening sequence, the storm on pride rock) but that's it, its just a beautiful copy with some serious delivery problems. Also, what the hell is up with that Beauty and the Beast reference? That was a wasted comedic opportunity to do something new and clever.

This brilliant CGI version of LK is a technical triumph. Never before has this new form of film making look so convincing. It is eye-popping - the animals, the environments, the whole of nature. The lack of people is a huge bonus.

Despite this, some contend there is no reason to remake the now 25 year old cartoon in this way, and maybe they have a point. The cartoon is excellent, vibrant and original. This version is very good but adds little to the original and when it is flat dramatically, this becomes an issue.

On the other hand, the script is sharp, the songs enjoyable (not superb), the performances are top class (who know John Oliver would make such a great bird?). Ejiofor's Scar is superb, as is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The leads - JE Jones, Donald Glover and Beyonce also acquit themselves well.

978071343,Braidin P,"Jon Favreau's ""The Lion King"" is underwhelming. First off, I really liked ""Reflections of Mufasa"" is the best music track in the movie. It felt just as powerful as it did in 1994. It's also visually stunning.  Besides that, it lacked what the original offered. Scar was more aggressive than satirical in this film. He felt very different than how he was in 1994. The biggest complaint is that lack of emotion that was shown in the Lions faces. For example, after Mufasa is trampled, McCrary does a decent job expressing the sadness in Simba's voice, but the Lion has a blank expression on his face. It takes away the power of the scene if Simba doesn't look upset about his fathers death. It's clear it's not possible to put such expressions on a ""life-like"" lion which is why the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. Pumbaa and Timon kept their original personalities which was very reassuring.

The 2019 version is somehow a half an hour longer than the original and that is mostly due to ineffective storytelling. Finally, the biggest gripe that I have with this movie is that it reveals nothing more of the story that we've all seen and loved, it is almost a shot for shot remake of the original but with (truly breath taking and amazing) CGI.

I find that very hard to believe unless the critic went into the movie not liking the idea that it's a remake from the start. If that were true, than the critic had a strong bias already. Another review somehow came to the conclusion that the technology controlled the movie. No, again: the animals and life-like appearance was realized by the audience from the start of the movie (assuming nobody in the audience saw any trailers beforehand). It was a very good balance of the technology combined with the voice acting that matched the animals brilliantly. I'd say 99% of the other children's movie reviews by those same critics would have some Debbie downer review to them as well. It's irritating to have to filter through reviews based on the validity of the reviews themselves. Hopefully, people check the audience reviews over the critics on this movie for that very reason.

978141881,Pernille L,"This movie was definitely beautiful to watch and I did enjoy watching it, but if I'm being honest, I exited the movie theater with a 'meh' feeling afterwards. The thing that drives this is the nostalgia, because without it, I don't think the movie would have done so well. 

I felt like it was missing someting. It did provide us with something new, as in new jokes, scenes and a new song, but it didn't evoke the same emotional response i get, when I watch the original. The animated animals, being as lifelike as they were, don't really articulate emotion very well (at least in my opinion). The infamous death of Mufasa fell kinda flat to me and this is a scene that always brings me to tears. There is a certain disconnect, when you can hear the sadness in Simbas voice, but the animation cannot show the despair in his face, which the original did very well. 

Another thing, and this is probably just me, is that I couldn't differentiate between the different lionesses. If they didn't speak, Sarabi and Nala looked identical to me (but this is just nitpicking).

I would have loved for this beautiful CGI, the great actors and the creativity to be used to tell a new story, instead of making a frame by frame repeat of what we've already seen. ",2.5,2019-07-29T20:48:18.979Z

It was nice that James Earl Jones reprises his role as Mufasa.

Like 'The Jungle Book' and 'Aladdin', I was curious as to 1) how a live adaptation would look and 2) what changes would be made to make the story more interesting. On the first note, the film looked amazing. Seeing everything in live action made the viewing worthwhile. However, do not go into this movie expecting anything but a shot-for-shot remake. In fact, the minor changes that were made from the original, are to the detriment of the overall story. Some of my favorite shots from the animated version were missing, whereas others (pretty much the entire opening 'Circle of Life' scene) were exactly as you remember from the 1994 version. Bottom line, the animated version was much better and there was no need for this film if they were going to stick so close to the original. It was like seeing your favorite black and white comic redone by different artists in a color version that was not as good as the original. I walked away from this film thinking ""why""?

789641593,Richard S,"I thought I was emotionally stable enough to cope with The Lion King.  It turns out I was wrong. I won't cover the story here because surely there is no one currently on planet Earth who does not know the story of The Lion King? However, I will say it's pretty much a scene by scene copy, with a few extra fillers to stretch the film out to it's 2 hour running time.  The screenplay has had some alterations but a lot of the classic and most memorable scenes are scripted the same with a few amusing nods to the original where the script has been updated slightly. 
Visually the film looks amazing and it is the realism that perhaps makes a couple of the scenes (hyenas in the elephant graveyard) a little scarier and perhaps not suitable for the really small people, and THAT scene in the gorge with the stampede is made a whole lot more emotionally gut wrenching. 
The voice cast are all pretty good, the hyenas weren't as funny as the original and the ""ooh Mufasa, say it again"" line is missing which is pretty tragic but it's only a small quibble. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner were perfect choice for Pumba and Timon but the big one, the main attraction of this piece is Scar.  No one was going to be able to live up to Jeremy Iron's brilliant mix of camp and cruelty and in Chiwetel Ejiofor's favour, he doesn't attempt to replicate that performance.  He puts his own spin on the character, Scar in this version is somewhat darker but still just as enjoyable, he is one of the greatest villains in cinema history and Chiwetel does a more than decent job of voicing the iconic baddie on the big screen.

978176985,Samuel F,"Quick version: The story had nothing new to say, the graphics were good, Timone and Pumba were still funny, they ruined Raffiky.
Long version: Timone and Pumba were okay, they seemed to change the jokes enough to be fresh but without changing their dynamic. Raffiky (appologies if misspelled) was a ruined for me as they removed most of his lines including the great life advice and his sense of humour about life and accepting the past. Why did they made this change? I assume some people found his humour a bit dark or lacking empathy for a kid's movie, and I guess it was a bit violent.
The rest of the movie story was almost the same with only minor changes in dialog. The previously implied relationship that scar had with the hyenas was not there making the turn against him at the end a bit more believable but made the alliance with him early in the movie less believable.
One thing that was done pretty well was the animal behaviours seemed more realistic, which makes sense considering disney's nature documentary projects and of course the graphics were pretty impresive.",2.0,2019-07-29T09:08:47.160Z
978176978,Elmar G,"""Comparison is the thief of joy."" - Theodore Roosevelt

First of all, I am probably the biggest Lion King fan on this planet (self-proclaimed). I'm your typical '93 kid. Seeing my childhood memories coming to life and being recreated in a new and creative manner is something that I could never have dreamed of. When it comes to the Lion King, this was the live remake I was the most excited for.

My unpopular opinion: it was SUCH a great film. I went into the movie not expecting it to be exactly the same as the animation, and wanted to watch it as a film by itself. I went to go see it with an open mind. I did not want to watch it, and compare it to the original. I think that's the key in watching these remakes.

Overall, most people seem to be critiquing (complaining about) the ""emotionless"" characteristics of the animals. Personally, it did not affect my viewing experience at all. One could still feel the emotion, and feel the mood of every scene. If the animals were portrayed any other way, it would have felt awkward and unnatural in the ""live world"" that the team created. Especially in the ""real life world"" - it would not have suit the narrative. If you wanted to see unnatural emotions and expressions, then rather go watch the animation again. The cinematography compensates for these ""lack of emotions"", and creates a beautiful atmosphere that pulls you right into the story.

For me, my only critique would be the character-design of Scar. I think that, visually, he wasn't up to scratch. The absence of his signature black hair and more prominent scar on the face made him fade a bit.

All in all, I was absolutely mind-blown, and I have already seen it twice. People were tearing up during the Mufasa scene. People were SINGING the songs they heard when they grew up. I was very pleased with this live adaption of The Lion King, and would advise everyone to go watch it for themselves, and appreciate the fine art that was created.",5.0,2019-07-29T08:41:55.154Z

978176922,Ahmed M,"There was a lot of work put into making the animals as ""realistic"" as possible. If you want to see pretty animals go through the motions of the Disney classic, then this film is for you. The effects look amazing. But the ""realism"" works to it detriment. The emotion and heart in an animated move cannot be re-enacted with extremely photo realistic animals. The animals cant express facial emotion. Animals express emotion differently. I've never felt more cold during Mufasa's death because all the character's eyes are so dead. I'm sure the actors really tried, but when the voice comes out of expressionless faces, its for nothing. But even THATS tough because so many lines sound like the first take. 

It felt like they deflated the big moments and focused too much on the little moments. The stampede never had the feeling of urgency like it did during animation. Rafiki never gives the lesson about learning from your past. But what do they focus on? The entire journey of Simba's hair to Rafiki, down to when its eaten by a giraffe, then cuts to the giraffes poop being rolled by a dung beetle. Why. All you had to do was carry his hair by the wind. Thats it.

The cherries on top that really disappointed me? The Hyena's werent funny. They turned ""Be Prepared,"" the one song I liked from the original, into a lazy spoken word poetry slam with a note that sounded liked Chiwetel Ejiofor had a couple of shots before the song (not the actors fault, this definitely sounds like a voice directing issue with the tone of the song). No Steam, no lights, no sense of rising power... just an old lion pacing back and forth on rocks. Beyonce's voice was distracting as hell, and I guess they spent the last of the budget getting Beyonce in the first place because they couldnt afford to show Mufasa in the clouds. Yeah.

This film was wildly mediocre with respect to the voices, and if you're going to do a Nat Geo-style  remake, at least have some real animals and forgive out how to make that work.

976723497,Kenneth W,"The original ""The Lion King""  was the first movie I took my 4-year old son to watch.  It also became a favorite in our family's video collection. So, this movie has a special place in my heart.

Interestingly, as my son grew older and entered his college years, new friends (Scars) came into his life and he was talked out of the strong values, and principles instilled in him. Even his life calling, for which he was blessed with amazing leadership abilities and creative talents to fulfill, was derailed. Finally, he forgot who he was.

But as the years have gone by, just as in the movie, he was reminded, ""Remember who you are."" and take responsibility for your life and calling. Look to your duty, care for your family, and become a positive force in your community to protect and keep it strong.

Through the years I, too, have felt the discouraging forces of the world try to talk me out of my calling and purpose. Often times, I felt the voice of the King from Heaven say, ""Remember who you are. Remember who you are.""

The Lion King story reminds us that life is not all, Hakuna Matata. We can run away from reality and try to ignore it, but at some point the inner complacency and outer spreading evil must be faced and dealt with.

Opposing forces still try to hold my son at bay, but, I am happy to report the young prince is remembering who he is and is rising up to be the man he was meant to be. One day, he will stand at the top of Pride Rock as a true and noble king.",4.0,2019-07-28T22:30:13.795Z

970527632,Mubina V,"Absolutely loved this film. I'm a huge fan of the original and can say that this movie lived up to the majesty of the 1994 classic. The updated and photorealistic visuals and stunning CGI facilitated beautiful scenes that actually improved on some of the scenes in the original (for instance, the Circle of Life sequence in the beginning of the film was greatly improved by the enhancements of CGI). You really feel like you are ""in"" the African savanna when you watch this in 3D and IMAX. As for the acting, I absolutely loved Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timone and Pumbaa. They were hilarious and a wonderful throwback to the original beloved characters. Simba as a young cub was absolutely adorable. The songs as well were wonderful and Beyoncé's glorious vocals in songs like ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" and the new addition ""Spirit"" were emotional and empowering. Donald Glover is a great singer too and was a sympathetic adult Simba. And last but not least it was a treat having the great James Earl Jones back as Mufasa. The 1994 classic was perfection but this version holds its own too. ",5.0,2019-07-28T21:43:36.659Z
978176002,Max M,"First of all, a summary: The movie has stunning visuals (it is pretty much photorealistic), great voice actors (John Oliver as Zazu works especially well), the dialog is, in my opinion, a slight improvement over the original and the plot is unchanged from its great original. Hence the five-star rating.

Plot and dialog: The movie follows the original almost scene for scene. There are slight changes to the dialog, which are an improvement in my opinion. There is a little more depth to the relationship between Scar and the hyenas, a lot more character for Shenzi, a little stronger comedy overall and more depth to the relationship between Scar and the other lions.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the scenes is quite similar to the corresponding scenes in the original movie, so mostly lighthearted. There are the most differences when Scar and the hyenas are involved because these characters have become a little scarier and less goofy. The scene that involves Scar asking Zazu to sing songs to him is completely gone, instead, we have some new scenes of Scars rule that show his conflicts with the other lions and a dramatic scene that depicts Nalas escape from Scar and the hyenas to look for help (which leads to her finding out that Simba is alive). This is another example of Scar and the hyenas being portrayed as more threatening.

Visuals: As said above, the visuals are absolutely stunning and the animals look almost photorealistic.  This makes scenes that live of their colorful depiction of Africa even more impactful. The one downside is, that the more realistic depiction of the lions and the hyenas makes it take half a second longer to tell whether the lion on-screen is Nala or Sarabi, or cub Simba or cub Nala, Shenzi or another hyena. After about a second it becomes clear though. Action and night scenes are a little more affected by this.

Music: The one area in which I consider the movie a slight downgrade. The great songs of the original movie are still played in this version, but I think the original has a better version of ""Be Prepared"" and slightly better singing in other songs. This might be just personal preference.",5.0,2019-07-28T21:38:04.578Z

The writing.... 😔 They managed to take the most beautiful story and turn it into a misplaced mess. Many things were taken out and others kept which made for a lack of a complete story. The casting and voice acting was terrible! The voices did not fit the characters. The voices seemed rushed. No vocal expression. I liked the animation though - but everything seemed so awkward.

The Lion King is another attempt from Disney to make some more money off of already successful blockbusters. The original Lion KIng was colorful uplifting, had great musical numbers, and had actors that fit the parts well. This one's a different story. Let's take a look. 
First: With animation the characters can cry and show emotion. That's how they made the buffalo stampede scene so emotional and dramatic. In this one you can't have live action animals show emotion (cry) so you don't get that same feeling when Simba's father dies. You feel the complete opposite. You almost tell Simba to deal with it. 
Second: The actors added a lifeless voice contribution. Example: In the original the guy who played Timon the wisecracking weasle gave the character his humorous likeabilty. Whoever plays Timon in this debacle just didn't have the voice. He didn't give Timbone didn't have the comic persona. And overall just didn't sound like Timon. Seth Rogen i'll give credit. He was able to use his voice to sound close to the original Pumbaa. 
Third: The film's musical numbers were rushed and didn't have the upbeat originality of the predcessor. Mostly because of live action's lack of expression. Be Prepared is the most notable example. In the original the song is long, dramatic, and colorful. And it has all the colors, patterns, and dancing. With this one it's dark, Scar doesn't sound like he's singing and, it's very depressing and downbeat. 
Fourth: In the orginal when Simba's dad comes in from the clouds and tells him who he is and what his destiny it's the most powerful part of the movie. And you can see him, so you get the full effect. In this one you can't see the father (all you see are a bunch of clouds that have a lion's face) and it doesn't have that impact. You feel unsatisfied. 
To sum it up in a few short words it's dull, lifeless, lacks music and humor, and has cheesy special effects. Next time Disney! ",0.5,2019-07-28T15:57:58.910Z

977339671,Kevin J,"So thoughts on Lion King: I suppose it's a fine movie if you feel like seeing the exact movie as you did before in different packaging.

THE GOOD: Of course it looks pretty! The photorealism is incredible. Timon and Pumbaa always stole the show when they were on screen. They had energy and charisma and felt authentic. Beyonce's performance was fine, and actually outdid Donald Glover unfortunately. Scar was solid.

THE BAD: Songs were meh at best. Be Prepared was an utter failure. Can you Feel the Love tonight was too modern radio and didn't happen at night, so didn't make sense. Beyonce's song for Simba's return takes you out of a moment that should be emotionally fulfilling. Actually many places that should have been emotionally poignant fell flat throughout. 

Overall this film didn't bring enough new material to make it worthwhile in the long run. Sure it's fun to see what some of your favorite animated characters might look like together in nature, but that's about where it stops. It's virtually a strict retelling, and it does a good job of bringing the story to life, but in the end it's less compelling.",2.5,2019-07-28T14:54:45.890Z

978175468,Fox M,"This movie can be summarized by one word: WHY?!
Why was it ever made? Why are people still going to see it? And why is the audience score at the time of this review so high (88%)? Are people afraid of admitting it's awful? Do people at this time and age really think this passes for a 'good movie'?
The ORIGINAL Lion King is a masterpiece of animation and voice-acting and score and songwriting and storytelling. It's as close as it gets to being 'perfect'.
This 2019 remake is NOT anything of that. Sure, the photo-realistic scenery is impressive, from a technological point of view, but for all their realism there's something off with the way the animals move! On top of that, the animals are incapable of conveying emotion and expressions the way people or a cartoon can. Not even James Earl Jones can save it with his legendary voice-acting. Beyoncé can't voice-act. I'm sorry, I love her, but voice-acting is not her cup of tea! That said, I think Donald Glover did make a better adult Simba; I always thought the original was a bit of a wuss, and Glover brings more authority to the character.
The movie is padded with 30 extra minutes of useless/lengthier scenes, and for all their amazing photorealism, couldn't they have had a more pretty Africa? The whole thing is in brown and earthen tones and I saw glimpses of the bloom that plagued videogames that claimed to be photorealistic a few years ago.

795081994,Alan W,"Jon Favreau directs again, after his successful 2016 remake of The Jungle Book, with technological advances that can render super-photo-realistic images of animals and wildlife on-screen, which almost justify this remake, but it also proves to be a double-edged sword. With the result looking amazingly real like an Attenborough documentary, the action sequences, which are now simply visceral and stunning to look at, benefit the most from this upgrade. However, when they start talking and singing, I feel as if I'm on a bad hallucinogenic trip, something The Jungle Book remake somehow managed to sidestep. While songs can be played out in the background, that's a lot harder to do for the talking, no matter how they try to soften them up with camera angles and editing that avoid showing mouth movements directly or for long periods of time. The main story and plotting and Elton John's songs remain so faithful to the original (film & Broadway show), it's like a scene-by-scene remake; and narrative developments are on the fast side, often at the expense of proper characterization. The voice cast reflects Disney's new found racial and cultural sensitivities (Donald Glover instead of Matthew Broderick; Chiwetel Ejiofor replacing Jeremy Irons), with the exception of a few white comedians sidekicks who are funny when they go a little off-script, but the personality of their voices are so distinctive, you still think of them more as Seth Rogen and John Oliver than Pumbaa and Zazu. This is Disney's third remake in a row since March's Dumbo and whilst their box office takings may have justify the exercise, you can't help but feel disappointed, if not despair, at the dearth of originality and you miss the original animation's charm and innocence. Sometimes just because you can, doesn't necessarily mean you should. ",3.0,2019-07-28T13:30:25.933Z

978175004,David L,"The Lion King 2019 Review
The Disney Cashcow is back and looking more realistic than your local zoo.

Pros:
The beautiful visuals. 
Voice Acting
Keeps the same great story that has captivated us 25 years ago. 
Hans Zimmer's score was pretty much untouched. 
Still some of the best music found in any animated picture.

Cons:
Rafiki role was all but deleted
Compared to the Original the facial expressions are non-existent 
Some character interpretations are a bit off. 
Missed opportunities…

Story: 4
I would be completely baffled if you haven't already seen the original film, but if you haven't here is a quick rundown. Mufasa is king of pride rock and has a younger brother (Scar) who is technically next in line to be king. Mufasa has a cub (Simba) who is now the true successor to the throne. Scar tricks Simba into going to a dangerous place called the Elephant Graveyard, in hopes that he is killed by the denizens that live there. The plan fails when Mufasa gets there in time to save Simba and Nala (Female lion cub / Simba's friend). Scar then plots with the Hyenas to Kill Mufasa and Simba by creating a stampede using wildebeest. This plan only partially succeeds by killing Mufasa. Unknowingly to Scar, Simba manages to escape the hyenas and flees the pride lands. In the aftermath of Mufasa's death, Scar takes over as king. Simba is found by Timon and Pumba where they teach him that you can't change the past so don't worry about it (""Hakuna Matata""). Nala Escapes the pride lands to look for help because Scar and the Hyenas are destroying it. Nala eventually runs into Simba where she tries to convince him to come back and take his rightful place as king. He refuses. Rafiki soon after runs into Simba and, with the help from Mufasa teaches Simba you can't run from your past, you have to learn from it. Simba makes is way back to the pride lands where he challenges scar, learns the truth about his father's death and ascends as the new King. 
The Lion King has all the chemical makeup for an excellent film and the remake keeps these attributes. I just wish they took advantage of this and expanded a bit more on the story.

Visual: 4.5
The original film was an animation marvel, even by today's standard. Smooth animation bright and vibrant colors, expressive facial expression that mimic the voice actors, and the illusions of real-life camera work / tricks. 
The 2019 version of the film is no slouch on the eye candy. The hyperrealism makes the film look like a Nat-Geo documentary. If you thought the CGI in the Jungle Book remake was stunning, you haven't seen anything yet. 
While the visuals pretty much make every other CGI animated film look last gen, there is one thing that kinda sticks out. Part of what made the classic Lion King animation stand out is the expressiveness through body language and facial expression. If you are looking for that this time around you will be fresh out of luck. Besides mouth moving while talking and singing, these cats look and act like, well… Big cats. Its just part of the deal, Jon Favreau and Disney were clearly going for ""What If"" The Lion King happened on Planet Earth. 

Audio: 4
There is no denying that the 1994 cast would be just about impossible to live up to, and honestly it was. Don't get me wrong though, the cast for the 2019 film is still amazing, and well done. I think the approach this time was to interpret the characters your own way, and all of them did a pretty good job at it. James Earl Jones is the only original cast member to reprise his role and he was brilliant. JD McCrary played young Simba and was great. He performed the number ""I just can't wait to be king"" and he did it better than the original if you ask me. Also his after the stampede / Mufasa Death scene was heart wrenching. Maybe even more than Johnathan Taylor Thomas's performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor played a good Scar but Jeremy Irons left some huge shoes to fill. I think I will have to say Jeremey had the better performance. Beyoncé's Nala was on point. I was a little nervous that she would be too much Beyonce if that makes any sense. Donald Glover also had some big shoes to fill. Every movie Matthew Broderick played in his voice just screams Simba to me, but I have to admit I love Glover's interpretation of the character. It feels like a up dated version of the original. They made the right choice going with Childish Gambino because he can sing. His rifting at the end of ""Hakuna Matata"" was pure gold and he was getting better and better. I hated the song had to end. Much like Donald Glover, Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are like updated versions of the originals. Ernie Sabella, and Nathen Lane are Pumba and Timon. In my opinion, and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner feels the same.
Soundtrack wise The Lion King 2019 is once again a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer pretty much just bedazzled his work and, its music to my ears. If the original score made you feel like the orchestra is playing in the same room as you, the new and improved version puts you right were the conductor is standing and you are surrounded by blends of harmonies and melodies. 
Beyoncé and Donald Glover lend their voices to the movie classic ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" and it came out very well done. I prefer it over the original movie version. I have to admit that Disney did miss an opportunity though, I would have loved to here a Beyonce Rendition of ""Shadowland"". The new song ""Spirit"" is pretty good though and made it into the film.  

Final Thoughts 
The Lion King 2019 is a great film, not perfect…  but these remakes usually aren't. Most of its bigger faults I was capable of getting over by being immersed by photorealism and Hans Zimmer's intoxicating score. A lot of critics of the film state not being about to get past the lack of facial expression. The thing is Jon Favreau / Disney wanted to go with the Hyper realism and in reality big cats don't have facial expression so it would look really unnatural or comical (think Alex The Lion from the Madagascar Series). They also complained that it was basically a prettier carbon copy or the original. To me that's more of a complement because the 1994 classic is one of the greatest animated films period. I still have to admit that I would have liked them to expand on character interactions more. It felt like the moment I warm up to Donald Golver's Simba he was already running back to the pride lands. I feel like they should have done something similar to what they did in The Lion King 1 ½ where they added scenes. 
Overall II highly recommend seeing the film. Ignore the critics especially if you enjoyed the original movie.

941919463,Matthew D,"An entertaining but soulless version that mimics the original without mimicking what made it work in the first place. Often times, I was bored throughout this film, which is strange since I loved the original. This version extends scenes to the point of mediocrity. The music is the same and still sounds great (minus one song that got completely changed for the worse).
The visuals look incredible, but they're also the film's biggest flaw. The animated film works better because it is an animated film. This film tries to go for realism but it just doesn't quite work. 
If you want to see this film, I implore you to just watch the original. It is the superior version. ",2.5,2019-07-28T05:27:09.512Z

Nala meeting Simba, as adults, was so bad. Dialogue was rushed and paced awkwardly...and because it's Beyonce, they had to give her some more things to do and had her say ""Lions, attack!"" which made my theatre laugh, at what was originally an important moment - when Scar confesses and Simba starts fighting him.

The whole time I was watching the movie I was waiting for it to begin. The beginning till the last 15 minutes could have been summarized in 20 minutes, and about half the movie was all about passing the time instead of advancing the plot. It ended in the most cliche way imaginable. Also I really think the type of animation they used was incredible but placed in the wrong movie.

So this film was absolutely gorgeous! Call it what you will, live action or animation. This really was an incredible achievement in film making.

The cast of voices- while very talented were poorly selected, or terribly executed- as if they worked as individuals and not together.
JD McCrary did a very good job as young Simba but some of the innocence that was brought to the animated role by Jonathan Taylor Thomas was lost. 
Seth Rogen did really well as Pumba and James Earl Jones is an irreplaceable voice- they were my only real joy. 

The worst part was the remake of ""Can you feel the love tonight"" a lovely song turned into a competion of vocals- like nails on a chalkboard.
Beyonce's voice is absolutely beautiful as is Donald Glover's voice- but not together and not for this song. Maybe take a lesson from the original or even the Pentatonix cover of how voices should work together in a duet.

I even liked the fact that the storyline did not venture far from the original narrative. I thought the actors did exceedingly well bringing these beloved characters to life and that Beyonce brought out a brave, strong and fierce Nahla. The iconic voice of James Earl Jones was amazingly still as powerful and resonant as it was all those years ago, and I was as enthralled as I was then. Some complain that they miss the facial expressions from the original; but c'mon...it was an animated, cartoon. How deeply were we really connecting to facial expressions?

978173951,Nicholas S,"The ""Lion King"" is a remake at heart. It's basically a scene by scene recreation of the 1994 classic. The problem is that the characters don't show emotion very well.

Very little emotion is conveyed, even though felines naturally have very expressive faces. The voice acting is a bit flat, even Mufasa! Beyonce is NOT a voice actor. Poor casting.

976256175,Aaron G,"In Jun. 1994, The Lion King made its first debut into theaters, and since then it has been widely popular and more musical going into the 21st Century. But the new one that I watched today was very, very wonderful, delightful, and looked realistically good. Mind you, I was not there for the original Lion King when it came in theaters in June of '94 because when I was one year old I would stay with family and watch educational programs/channels on TV. But somewhere near '99 or 2001, I was able to watch Lion King on VHS at my elementary school. Movie-wise I like both versions of The Lion King equally and just the same; music is the same. I was also there for the 3D Lion King when it came out in 2011. Either way, animation was spot-on with both versions; storyboard made sense; loved the music.

Then the scene in which Simba is supposed to see his dad in the clouds was cut out and normal clouds were show instead, which completely killed the atmosphere and importance of that scene. We don't see Simba falling down in those flowers and all the scenes when he's trying to figure out who he is. All of the character development was thrown away to make room for cheap gags.

977683833,Kyle A,"All my life, The Lion King was my favorite Disney movie and still is to this day. I've always anticipated what a ""live action"" version of this story would be like. Perhaps I should've stuck with the original and no remakes…
This movie is a visual achievement and there Is no denying it. The animals all look photo realistic even though they are 100% CGI. For the most part, this movie was the movie I wanted to see. It is almost quite literally a shot for shot remake of the Lion King which I loved. This didn't change big parts of the story like Aladdin did and it stayed very faithful to the original. Some of the shots they recreated put big smiles on my face and made me reflect a lot on my childhood. It was great to listen to James Earl Jones again as Mufasa and Seth Rogen as Pumba was fantastic casting. This movie gave me the story I wanted to see and the one that I know and love. This movie gave me the fleshed-out characters that I know and love. Unfortunately, it lacked any and all of the energy and emotion that the first one had.
One of the biggest positives of this film, was also its biggest issues. The photo realistic design of these animals is truly incredible and what the effects crew did with that was terrific. But, with the animals looking so real, it takes away expression and emotion which brings me to my next problem. I don't know if the voice actors are to blame, or if they were just given dialogue and told not to have much emotion behind their voice because this film, felt soulless. In the original, Mufasa's death was a horrifying and sad scene to witness. Scar lived in the moment and cherished his opportunity to kill his brother and you could feel the tension in his menacing voice. As Mufasa fell to his death, we saw the true horror in Simba's face as his dad died before his eyes. In this movie, Simba just looked like a baby lion roaring and sounded like a kid who dropped his ice cream on the ground. That's just one example among an entire 118 minute runtime. Somethings about the original that they changed were completely nerfing Raficki. He wasn't even close to being as good as he was in the original. He was just bland, humorless, and seemed to not care that Mufasa and Simba were both dead. All of the songs felt empty and bland ESPECIALLY be prepared which was heavily nerfed. I'm also confused as to why they didn't recast Jeremy Irons as Scar because I'm sorry, Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't do it for me as Scar. Shall I even say that James Earl Jones even felt tired delivering some of his lines as Mufasa. But again, who do I blame? The too good CGI or the voice acting? Also some of the stuff they added did nothing new for the story. There's an extended scene of Nala sneaking out of pride rock to get help and it goes on waaay too long. There's also an extended scene of Timon and Pumba singing ""The lion sleeps tonight"" which while charming, it wasn't necessary. I would've preferred that we get some back story on Scar on how he got the scar in the first place as he mentions early in the film. That would've filled the runtime so much better in my opinon.
As you can see this film frustrated me very much. Although there is a lot to like in this movie, that being the characters and the story and visuals, but it all feels so empty. Disney went 0 for 3 this year with live action and after messing up Aladdin and The Lion King, two favorites of mine, I say Disney should call it quits with these movies. But hey, they've both made over 1 billion dollars so unfortunately, we will continue to get more of these shameless cash grabs. The Lion King ever so disappointingly gets, a C+

977650966,Kazi F,"Credit where credit is due: I can't even begin to imagine the how Disney was able to accomplish the technical achievement that went behind creating the breathtaking visuals of this movie. However, at the end of the day it falls under the category of ""their animators were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" Hete are 10 Reasons, in no particular order, why you shouldn't fork over your hard earned moneys to watch the new photorealistic remake of Lion King:

1. It's photorealistic which means you'll quickly come to the realization that irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, unlike a cartoon where, regardless of species, you can clearly tell how a character is feeling through exaggerated features. So basically Simba has the exact same f***ing expression(pictured above) when he's palling around with Nala as he does when he's mourning over the loss of Mufasa's dead ass. Moreover, as you may or may not have noticed, animals don't usually dance and prance around in nature so a musical number such as ""I just can't wait to be king"" is just way less fun
2. Apparently Chiwetel Ejiofor is too cool to sing, so my personal favourite musical number ""Be Prepared"" was replaced by a little recruitment seminar
3. No luau Timon.
4. Everything is the same as the original but worse.
5. You can use the money you would have used to watch this to buy a DVD/Blu-Ray version of Lion King 1994 and have a much better time
6. All the characters are devoid of personalities because, once again, irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, so at any given moment whenever two characters are interacting with each other without the presence of dialogue it just seems like they're blankly staring at each other. What's that Simba, you're thinking about boning Nala later? Couldn't tell, cuz you're a f***ing lion who's incapable of conveying emotions through your face
7. So I read this article which said that lions that have darker manes are typically more masculine because the darker manes are caused by extra testosterone pumping through their bodies and so they're usually more physically endowed thereby considered the alpha of their respective prides and to account for this it looks like they made scar's mane lighter? Idk it might just be me, I read this like 5 mins before watching the movie and it may have skewed my perception a tad. 
8. The once malicious, conniving Shakespearean villain that was Scar has been rendered a bland, soulless echo of his former self because of, you guessed it, the limitations of photorealism
9. It's not even live action like the other remakes. Everything was done in a computer anyway, so like, what even is the point? 
10. Stop encouraging Disney to make more of these by giving them your money. THEY ARE RELEASING 4 LIVE ACTION REMAKES IN 2019 ALONE AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED

The biggest and most upsetting part of this movie was the  atrocious voice acting. There was no passion no bravado nothing. It was if they were reading it off the script. The only person that let personality come through and played the character wonderfully was Seth Rogan playing as Pumba that was funny. Also credit to Billy Eichner for a good Timon. JD Mcrary needs to stay far far far away from voice acting as he was plainly awful as young simba. There was no emotion no feeling of guilt when Mufasa died no feeling of fear when Mufasa needs to speak to him after almost getting himself and Nala killed in the elephant graveyard. Young Nala was mediocre. Donald Glover as much as I love him was simply okay. Had some good moments but was not into it. Beyoncé 🤦🏻‍♂️ I'm sorry no hell no. Please god get her away from voice acting as she is terrible too. Also the stupid and unnecessary spirit song when they are running back to the pridelands was stupid and again unnecessary. This Movie if you can call it that is a shame to even be called a remake of the master piece that the original still is. One more thing who the hell thought it was an awesome idea to put John freaking Oliver as Zazu??!!! Ugh again voice acting is what killed this movie for me. The animation was okay but if it's all cgi why make it so expressionless? Add some Disney magic and make it better. Throughly disappointed. James Earl Jones got too old. Or wasn't directed correctly because he voice isn't stern. Doesn't have the same impact. So yeah for me it's a one star rated movie and that's only because of the beautiful jungle scene.

906794753,Matt G,"My question going into the latest ""pay-us-for-your-nostalgia"" Disney-remake was, ""Why do we need this? What new can it bring?"". Technically, the CGI animation is impressively state-of-the-art and new. Otherwise, my worst fears were warranted. It's not just similar to its source material but is 100% the same in almost every aspect. From moment one, when the iconic ""NAAAH SA-VIN-YAAAH!"" bursts forth, I realized they were so beholden to the '94 classic they didn't even bother rerecording that vocal. It sets the stage for both the larger things (story beats / scenes), as well as the smaller things (specific line deliveries), to be a lazy karaoke tune. So frustratingly unimaginative, it makes 2019's Aladdin look like a feat of original storytelling.
Thankfully, the greatness of the story is left untouched, though it was already plenty great without being redone. The few things that are changed don't expand the story, but just extend scenes past the point of reasonable story economics. We're forced to sit through self-congratulatory animation montages that are useless beyond ""look what we did!""
Crowds seem to be going for the cast, and many of those performances are the highlights. Listening to Glover & Beyonce sing together is special, Scar is decently rendered, and Rogen & Eichner offer the most unique and successful moments. Still, with dialogue so slavish, you can sense the actors desperately trying not to copy what they grew up hearing.
Honestly, even the technical brilliance is often a hindrance. By making the animals photoreal, we take away individual personalities, physical nuances, and even facial expressions, all of which help us relate to their plight. So, again I ask, why do we need this?",1.5,2019-07-26T14:01:25.925Z

And the fights were truly inspiring I believe that if they had the same dialogues or at least the most importan ones...

If you take out all of the fun and color, what you're left with is 2019's The Lion King. Like many remakes, this is a wholly unnecessary one. It doesn't tread any new ground and what's changed simply isn't for the better.
It represents a disturbing trend in Hollywood, and especially from Disney, to just remake things that were already good. Why? Profit. That's it. That's the bottom line. Outside of its technical achievements there's no real care or heart put into this film, and it shows. It's just the original, but not as good.

784969405,Tyler Y,"Tragic, Shakespearean, violent are words to describe the new Lion King. I was 4 when the movie was in theaters. For 20+ years this has been my favorite movie. In the first 5 minutes of the film, I became disconnected. There are funny jabs and adlibs from Eric, Key, and Seth that help save some of the lighthearted comedy that the original was full of. It lacked the emotional coaster of the 1994 cartoon. I left feeling empty. The scenes were drawn out wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, and the songs were so far from the originals that they seem like techno compared to rock and roll. I went in with an open mind and left with a broken heart.Although The final scene was leaps and bounds better then the original;  My final thought was, if you want to take the expression and the goofiness, out of the charters to make it seem more real, then why don't the lions suffocate the enemy, and where is the blood. I get the director wanting something different, but if they would have just made a copy paste remake of the original with the same visuals with the added creativity of the new roll, they would have had the same turnout without the pissed off feedback. Now we have to wait another 20+ years for them to fix it.  P.S. Be prepared (my favorite scene/song) was reduced to a poem with horrible sustained notes, which made me want to plug my ears.

915900746,Yash B,"The 1994 classic version of ""The Lion King"" is still my favorite animated movie of all time to this day. Naturally, I was a little skeptical when I heard they were remaking the movie into a live-action (or in this case, really good CGI). It didn't feel particularly necessary and definitely came off as a cash grab. There were certain things in this new version I liked a lot less than the original, but I think as a whole, I still enjoyed it. The movie plays it safe in terms of the story and is almost a scene for scene remake, which I liked. I think the story is perfect and there was no reason to change any of the events in the story and for the most part its the same movie in a lot of ways. I liked most of the songs, except for a few that I felt were a lot more effective in the original. However, even though a few of the songs aren't as well done, Hans Zimmer's score is still unforgettable and effective. The film's greatest strength is the stunning visual effects. If there's any reason to see this movie in theaters, its the visuals. Everything does look pretty lifelike and it really was a treat for the eyes. What this movie severely lacks is the genuine emotional center the original movie had. The characters are realistic and therefore aren't able to show emotion in their faces in moments where the animation could. Also, the movie features a lot of the exact same dialogue but a lot of it doesn't really have the same punch as the original. Sometimes certain things that characters say feel flat and lifeless here, and the exact same words had an entirely different effect in the original. If you can overlook some of the movie's flaws, it still has some moments that are handled very well. Overall, while I don't see myself watching this movie again because I think the original is far better, it was enjoyable to experience this timeless story again in theaters.",4.0,2019-07-26T06:48:51.318Z

875992405,Ariel J,"Honestly, I was really looking forward to this movie- then the second trailer came out and I was like... well, hmmm- I trust this. It's gonna be better than that, right? 
Well, the day it came out, I went in an afternoon showing in an AMC IMAX, plopped down and the opening song, The Circle of Life looked beautiful.  The song was gorgeous and the ... graphics... the imagery was breathtaking. It was note by note exactly like the animated one- but- ok. Cool. And then, BOOM The Lion King stamps onto the screen- but like what seemed like a second and a half too quickly. And it was from that moment on did the ants from the branches the de-focus onto the zebras below start to crawl up my legs and onto my body as I watched the rest of of this retched movie. 
The timing was all off, the emotion want there. Not even the actors who played the parts in a booth sounded like they wanted to be there. There was NO energy to this at all. And it wasn't just that the animals didn't emote. Everyone (except Simba as a cub, he had some energy) was just so flat. 
Don't get me started on Be Prepared. I just won't even talk about how terrible that was. 
I love almost all movies. Just ask any of my friends or family. They never take my advice on movies because I always find something I like about a movie and sell it on that. I can't with this. 
Ok, The Lion King is a cherished movie of mine, the animated one from what... 1994? I'm aging myself but as a kid I loved this movie. The animation, the songs the heart. Realizing what it is to live because there is a finality to it all.  And what goes around comes around. And Hakuna Matata and be responsible. Be prepared. So many things of who I am today come from being a cute little kid and soaking it all up. Why try to change that?

978171744,Kimba P,This was horrifically underwhelming. The animation though impressive at time under no circumstances should be used for this type of movie. The lion king is known as a very emotional movie and realism where it is almost impossible to show expression due to that the lion king was a terrible choice to use realism in. Due to the extreme realism these characters can not show emotion at all and it makes it almost impossible to sympathize with any of the characters. Along with that with this style the voice acting just seems off especially for Zazu it doesn't feel like the natural voice many of these characters would have due to their realism in almost every single way except their voices. Every scene is basically the same from the original along with many of the lines. It would make sense to of course keep the main iconic lines but they keep many of the ordinary lines the same as well.

A few years ago Disney rereleased the original Lion King in theaters. I remember going with my wife and taking my two young kids. We loved it, just as much as when we were kids. Our kids loved it. The original animation film was and is brilliant!

We have liked nearly all of the live-action adaptations, so we were looking forward to this one greatly. As visually stunning as it was, I was bored to tears, my son was bored to tears, and my sister even fell to sleep. 

I get it, they were trying to make it as realistic as possible. But let's be serious for a second, lions don't talk... You have to draw the line somewhere between reality and entertainment. I just feel they drew the line WAY too far on the realistic side. I would have been far more entertained if they went ultra realistic and presented it as a nature show in Africa, sans voices of course.

897821541,Kendra D,"I loved it! I honestly went into the theater, determined to hate it. The Lion King is my all-time favorite Disney movie, maybe even favorite movie, period. So I didn't think they could possibly live up to the original. However, I appreciated that it was basically a shot-for-shot remake, but with a bit of extra material to give us something new. Is it as good as the original animated movie? Of course not. You can't expect a live action film to have that same magic, but it was wonderfully made. All the people complaining about the animals facial expressions sound ridiculous. If the animals had been given more emotional facial expressions on such realistic looking faces it would have been a level of absurdity on par with awful movies such as The Country Bears....and NO ONE should want that! My biggest worry was Be Prepared. Again, the original song is much more entertaining, but I concede that the new version works better with the overall atmosphere of the remake. I'm not sure why critics have been so hard on this movie, other than critics are generally miserable human beings who only seem to like boring, political movies that usually make viewers want to put themselves out of their misery. Don't listen to them. Go see it and make up your own mind! I cried as I watched the beautifully shot opening scene and at the end of the movie, the entire(very full) audience applauded. That should tell you something! I'm fairly certain I was the biggest kid in the theater. My seven year old self came out for a couple hours as I was transported back to my childhood.

959180867,Travis C,"Occasional eye candy achievements don't distract enough from a limp imitation of the former film's strong storytelling. Their faux-realism (or just poor directing and editing) constrain the characters, emotion and plot as they surprisingly abridge useful moments or extend meaningless (and self-indulgent) tangents. For the first time in a long time I felt literal dead air in professional cinema. With new lines like, ""Lions, attack!"", ""I will always fight a bully!"" and a slew of self-aware, soft improv humor that literally steps on itself the film fails to be either Planet Earth or an animated favorite but something caught in-between. Don't listen to people who call it 'Darker' or, god-forbid, 'MORE Shakespearean.' The sense of peril (darkness) is missing almost everywhere (the sensitive lack of nearly eating mice, crushing bugs, elephant skulls or seeing even a drop of blood in this photo-real setting stands out) and Jeremy Irons's original performance as Scar WAS about as Shakespearean and masterfully theatrical as film performances come! They mean to say, the story is lacking but they still want to respect it, like Shakespeare. It's always dangerous to do a cover of even a song, unless you are spot on in imitation - or it's presented in SUCH an original light that the old product takes on new meaning...a la: Broadway's The Lion King! Disney already successfully adapted, probably improved, this very same IP and yet even the gems from that version ('He Lives in You' or female Rafiki's role as storyteller) were void. Nothing sums up the overall film more than its use of Beyoncé's new pop-song that was slapped over Simba's formerly iconic return to crestfallen Pride Rock: while the sound of her voice is breathtaking as it flexes it's skill, it does hardly more than repeat the words, 'Spirit' and 'Yeah' without context, and in doing so robs a story-driven (and beloved) score from the former film. CGI wizardry does a good job to deliver little more than the ""Spirit!"" and ""Yeah!"" of a masterpiece that didn't need fixing. ",1.5,2019-07-25T18:27:54.365Z

978171019,James P,"I saw this movie. IT was ok. but it didnt blow we away. I expected graphics to be good because it is disney but disney out smarted themselves. The graphics were so good it watered down the story. When the lions talked it seemed like they were mumbling, Disney made a movie 15 years ago called Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe that had a better talking lion in it than this one. The other way they out smarted themselves is they made the lions so good that they couldnt do the night scene for can you feel the love tonight. They could have easily made it live action but enhanced the colors better so they could do that scene properly. Another night scene they had issues with was scar and simba fight. because there isnt a distinction, other than a scar, between the 2 lions its hard to figure out which is which. Last 3 things. Be prepared is one of the great songs in Disneys history and probably the great by a Disney Villian and they practically cut it out. In the original Jeremy iron through out his voice. And some of the Voices just didnt match the characters. Beyonce was great but she really over powered Donald Glover during there song. Maybe thats what they wanted.  It wasnt all doom and gloom I thought Zazu, Timon, and Pumba were very well done and extremely funny. To me they made the movie.

Bringing back the legend that is James Earl Jones as Mufasa was an amazing decision, this could have been followed by bringing some others back such as Rowan Atkinson as Zasu and Jeramy Ions as Scar.

827144356,Jelani W,"Was a ""live action"" version of The Lion King necessary? No. Did it live up to the original? No. Was it a bad film? Not at all. The Lion King remake was fine; I think critics are being way too harsh on it. The visuals were done really well...most of the voice casting was on point; the only 2 that didn't work for me was, sadly James Earl Jones; you can tell he's getting older because he didn't have the energy that he did in the original. The other one was Beyoncé. I'm a huge fan of her as a singer and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Spirit"" were great but her voice acting didn't work for me. The stand outs were Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. They had me cracking up from the moment they came on screen and I actually liked their version of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" better than on the original film. The only thing that really bothered me in the film was the new version of ""Be Prepared."" I didn't like it at all. At the end of the day, if you're looking for the magic that was captured in the original, you'll be severely disappointed; if you're looking for a good time at the movies, you'll have just that and I believe that's why, despite the harsh reviews, it's still making money because people are having a good time watching it.

But despite all of that, I really enjoyed it. I don't know how I can explain how much I'm proud of world and people and technology for being able to make films like The Lion King. That's so unbelievable; everything in this movie look so realistic, I can't believe it.

However, given how many of us already know this story so well, I was really surprised to see Disney play it so safe. With quite literally no new scenes or characters or anything to make it stand out from the original, this reminds me of that ill-fated shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. Although the voice acting was generally great, particularly Pumba, Timon, and Zazu, and it is gorgeous to look, I found myself nodding off right around the time the climactic confrontation was happening, during a first date with a girl I've been wanting to see for months, which is a very good indicator of how involved I was in the film. There were a lot more fart jokes than in the original and the only new sequence I noticed involved a beetle rolling around some giraffe poop with a tuft of simba's hair in it (it was actually way better than it sounds and a more visceral representation of the circle of life).

I was surprised that they even had a screenwriter since at least 80% was word for word the same to the animated movie. It didn't add anything new, exciting, or something meaniningful to the plot like previous live-action films have, or at least tried to, and the emotions of the characters didn't make me feel much of anything. I will give major props to Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen who were great in their roles. And, of course, the legend himself James Earl Jones.

880942050,Daniel A,"The Lion King looks amazing, the CGI looks so good that one would think they're  watching a National Geographic documentary. All the realistic animal mannerisms are perfectly done. The action sequences and fights might even upset small children since they look so real. The score by Hans Zimmer is great, as is most of the songs in this re-make of the iconic classic. The opening felt just as epic as the original as well. 

All this familiarity leads to one of many issues with this film. It is literally 95% a copy of the original with little original input  (unlike Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast). It was surprising since I've been told John Favreau (Iron Man 1 & 2) did a great job with the Jungle Book.  Sometimes I found myself bored unless Scar or Timon and Pumbaa were on screen. Let me give props to Chiwetel Eijifor (12 Years a Slave, Doctor Strange) for his take on the iconic villain Scar, he made a believer out of me and you could feel all the jealous and scornful emotion in his voice acting. 

Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) stole the show here as their voice actors did a great job. John Oliver as Zazu was okay as his voice was sometimes jumping in and out of Rowan Atkinson's (Mr. Bean) version from the original movie.  Keegan Michael Key, Eric Andre, and Florence Kasumba did a decent job as the Hyenas enough that I didn't miss Whoopi Goldberg and her crew from the original. JD Mc Crary did a nice job capturing the young Simba and of course it helps that youngster's singing talent is high. 

Now for the huge let down of this movie, Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, did a horrible job voice acting adult Simba. I'm a fan of his so I don't know what happened, his performance is mostly monotone with barely any emotion. His failure could not be saved by Beyonce who although very talented musically, is just an okay voice actress as adult Nala. She too fell to the ""I'm just reading a script in a studio"" trope, but still found some good moments, further making Donald Glover look bad. 

Perhaps it was a bad idea to give the Scar character such a good actor and give Simba/Nala music artists? Perhaps this is just an example of the supporting cast being better than the male lead? I read some audiences didn't like the lack of emotion from the animals but I understand why Disney did it. They wanted realistic ""animal instinct and emotion"". 

FINAL REVIEW: 6 out of 10. The weakest entry in the live action Disney remakes, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's because of Donald Glover's uninspired performance.

917823122,Kyle C,"I went into this movie thinking that ""The Lion King"" was going to be just another pointless remake for the big bucks at Disney. But what I ended up discovering was a live-action remake that, although at times, fall flat against the original, does pay homage and love to the animation. 

You can tell that Jon Favreau and the cast was excited to work on this film through all of the press releases and interviews. And although the film doesn't take a huge amount of creative risk (with the exception of Tumon and Pumba having some improv lines), I'd rather have this version of the film than the ""Beauty and the Beast"" remake, which dumbs down the film for a modern audience. 

I do wish that the movie did take some risk and add new material (there was a rumor going on for a while that ""He Lives In You"" was going to add to this film that I so wish was true). And I do wish that Favreau did take some creative risks when making this film, but I understand the hesitancy in doing so. ",4.0,2019-07-25T04:57:46.521Z
975392564,Krystal T,"Just because a film company has the ability to do something doesn't necessarily mean they should. 

There were so many scenes that were just so out of place and transitions that took so long to finish. It felt like their animation department got bored waiting for the next instruction so they started to mess around, then added their bumblings as movie filler. The scene where Rafiki discovers Simba is alive was never ending, not to mention it felt like it was stolen straight from the ""Polar Express"".

And no good one star review would be complete without a review of the characters. In the original ""Lion King"" Timon and Pumba were the plucky comic reliefs. Sure they were lazy, but their quirky quips and deep friendship and their parent-like affection for Simba was what made them likeable. In this movie they're @$$holes! Everytime they were on screen I couldn't wait for them to leave. Everything from their tone of voices to their dialogue was nihilistic. I understand their characters are lazy and carefree, but they go as far as making fun if the circle of life saying and I quote ""life is meaningless"". And it affects their relationship with Adult Simba (who when you first see as an adult acts like he's had a bit too much ""cat-nip"" if you know what I mean). Because the only scenes Timon, Pumba and Simba are in together set them both up as Simba's bullies (which is ironic due to Pumba's quote at the end of the movie) they seem more like   like the room-mates you can't wait to move out then a family unit.

With the negative comes the positive. The animations is flawless. Disney has perfected their textures and computer animation and you can tell a ton of research went into the making of this movie and how these animals would act in nature. You really couldn't tell CGI from actual footage unless you knew what to look for. While the scripts they were given weren't the best the actors/actresses did a comendable job in their roles
I would save your money and wait until it shows up on Netflix like all the other poorly made ""live-action"" movies.

However, the realness of the movie came at the sacrifice of the soul and personality of the movie that could not come close to the original animated movie. The juxtaposition of the almost expressionless CGI animals and the jokes and songs did not work for me. The voice acting was hit or miss. Donald Glover had his moments where he really shined, but also many where I felt like he was phoning it in. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner carried the movie from the second act onward as Timon and Pumbaa. Beyonce was the biggest disappointment as Nala unfortunately. Not only is her voice too recognizable, therefore ruining the immersion at points, but her lack of experience as an actress showed and she was only given one line at a time to speak, often breaking the natural flow of conversation.

977939403,Oscar A,"This is an update that follows very closely to the original with some little tweaks, it heralds a nice, enjoyable watch but doesn't fully work in the end. Obviously the original is a classic and the factors brought in from the old animation make for a great story with valuable morals. There is something strange about photo-realistic CGI animals singing, dancing and trying to show emotion. The films main problem is the animals lack of emotion shown. It just takes you out of it a bit and doesn't allow you to connect like the hand drawn animation does. The ""Long live the king"" line feels absolutely killer in the original but lacks oomph in this remake which is also telling as it's the turning point of the film.

the whole cinema was quiet and occasional yawns were heard here and there.. the only time it started to elicit massive reactions from the audience was when pumbaa said, ""you thought he's dead!? i thought i'm dead"", which happened an hour (or even more) after the movie screening started..",1.0,2019-07-24T22:07:45.249Z

Problem # 1 :
Because they wanted the ""Lion"" Characters to be African American, they didn't have the original voice of Scare! His voice and Mufasa's voice are the 2 most iconic voices!! So to know they did that was just so sad...if white people did that it would be F*$%#@ up too! I mean who does that! They ruined something so iconic and special due to politics... 

Problem# 2 :
Since this movie was a ""live action"", the emotion was lost! I felt confused the whole time. I was looking at ""real"" animals, yet they sound like cartoon characters...Weird! 

I think that if they wanted to do something truly different and special, they should have done the ""live action"" but with no voices! Almost like watching a BBC animal documentary! That would have been so creative and different!! 

But no...Just straight up a disappointment! The whole time I just wanted to be watching the original Lion King! I was thinking the whole time...why am I putting myself thought this misery of watching this, when I can watch the real one at home!

900619245,Nate Z,"Ever since the run-up of Disney's live-action remakes, I've been predicting what would happen with the newer films, and it all seems to be coming true. The problem with Disney remaking hit animated movies from the 80s and 90s is that there hasn't been enough distance. The immediate audience is going to demand their nostalgia exactly as they remember it, and they will not be happy with anything less. It's not like a scenario where the original movies could be improved upon, like 2016's beautifully tender Pete's Dragon. What these live-action remakes offer is an uglier, inferior version of an animated classic. There's no reason for most of them to exist. They won't be different; they won't be interesting. It's a sludgy, auto-tuned cash grab that shows no end in sight. Before this year, I did not expect Tim Burton's Dumbo to be the best of the three 2019 Disney live-action remakes, but here we are. I guess the concept of Disney eating its own tail with these live-action remakes is symbolic of the studio ""circle of life,"" and the perfect segue way to The Lion King, a remake missing the wonder and magic of the 1994 original.

King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones again) rules over an African prairie and preparing his young son Simba (JD Mcrary and Donald Glover as an adult) for his eventual rule. Mufasa's scornful brother Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) conspires to have Mufasa killed and Simba banished. Blaming himself for his father's death, Simba runs away and finds kinship with a meerkat named Timon (Billy Eichner) and a warthog named Pumba (Seth Rogen). They preach a carefree life of ""no worries."" This new life is interrupted when Nala (Beyoncé Knowles), Simba's childhood friend, returns seeking help to remove Scar from the throne. Simba must confront his fate and treacherous uncle and bring balance back to his ailing homeland.

The biggest appeal of director Jon Favreau's Lion King remake is the stunning special effects. It's been ten years since James Cameron brought to life a photo realistic alien world that dazzled audiences, and the advances have only made the professional fakery more startling. This movie was completely ""filmed"" inside a computer. Every single shot, every blade of grass, every pebble, every photo realistic morsel onscreen is the result of digital wizards. In 2016's The Jungle Book, there were still some physical elements filmed, chief among them the human boy, but now it's all done away. The remake looks like an HD nature documentary. One could question the use of the technology, $250 million to recreate what ordinary cameras on location could achieve, but I'll choose to congratulate Disney and Favreau on the remarkable technical achievement. The Jungle Book was a big leap forward and The Lion King is that next step. However, the special effects are ultimately the only selling point. Come see how real it all looks, kids. The rest of the remake left me feeling unmoved and occasionally perplexed.

This is an almost exact shot-for-shot recreation of the original movie. It made me think of Gus van Sant's 1998 Psycho remake and why anyone would go to this much trouble to make a copy. You'll feel a tingle of recognition with different shots and scenes and then that feeling will transition to disappointment and lastly resignation. It's the same, just not as good.

So what exactly is different with the live-action Lion King of 2019? Very very little. Despite totaling a half hour more movie, it really only has one added incidental Beyoncé song, a small character beat where Timon and Pumba explain their philosophy on more fatalistic terms, an explanation how Nala left the pride lands, and more poop and fart jokes. The filmmakers have added realism in appearance but also added more scatological humor, which seems like an odd combination. There is a literal plot point attached to giraffe poop. Instead of a whispery feather, petal, whatever finding its way to the baboon Rafiki to let him know Simba is still alive, now we watch the life of a tuft of fur as it travels from creature to creature, at one point being consumed on a leaf by a giraffe. The next image is a ball of poop being rolled by a beetle with our tell-tale tuft of lion fur. I guess it's more emblematic of the whole ""circle of life"" theme, but I didn't think Disney was going to literalize the poop aspect. The new Beyoncé song is fairly bland and unmemorable. That's it, dear reader. Lion King 2019 is 95 percent identical to Lion King 1994 in plot, and yet the original writers do not earn a screenwriting credit thanks to arcane animation writing guild rules, and that is madness. It's their story, it's their characters, and it's almost entirely their dialogue, and to not have their names rightfully credited where they belong is wrong.

There are some definite drawbacks to that photo realism as well. When lions and other animals are photo realistic, they have facial structures that don't exactly emote, so it looks like all the animals often just have their jaws wired shut. You'll listen to the vocal actors go through a range of emotions and watch these plain, unmoved faces that you start to wonder if maybe all of the dialogue should have just been voice over. As soon as I saw Mufasa speaking, I was immediately shaken by the image and longed for the expression of the animation. I never got over it and it made me feel removed from the film, even more so. This is the trade off of realism; animals don't actually speak, you know. Another trade off is that the film becomes much more intense especially for younger kids. I would not recommend parents take the littlelest ones to this movie because now, instead of watching a traditionally animated band of characters brawl, you're watching realistic lions and hyenas scrape, claw, and hurl one another to their deaths. If kids were traumatized by parts of the original movie, I can only imagine the nightmares that await. Strangely, the photo realism also mitigates the film's sense of scope and impact. The stampede sequence feels far less dangerous because the camera doesn't pull back that far, showing a massive herd from a distance. Subsequently the sequence loses some of its urgency. Then there's also simply identifying who may be who when those fights come, because you're trying to pick out realistic animals instead of distinct creatures with specific character designs.

The aspects you enjoyed with the 1994 Lion King will still be enjoyable, even if they suffer in direct comparison. Hans Zimmer's score is still magnificent. The songs are still catchy, though some of the arrangements are a bit under-cooked, like the speak-sung ""Be Prepared."" The song ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" occurs absurdly early in the Simbla/Nala reunion and takes place in the sunny afternoon. So much for ""tonight"" (the famous Nala ""bedroom eyes"" moment is also quite diminished from a real lion's face). The jokes are still funny because they were funny the first time. The things that worked the first time will still work to some degree, even if the presentation leaves something to desire. Several of the vocal artists just sound flat, especially Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) who comes across so blasé. I missed the casual menace of Jeremy Irons. The best vocal performances belong to Eichner (Difficult People) and Rogen (Long Shot), maybe because they're already broad personalities, or maybe because they felt the most comfortable to occasionally steer away from the original script, finding small room to roam. Florence Kasumba (Black Panther) also delivers a snarling and effective performance as one of the hyena leaders, Shenzi. They're the only vocal performances that fare well in competition.

I need to defend the art of animated films. There is nothing wrong with animated films simply because they are animated. A live-action version is not better simply because it's more ""real."" I hear this same argument when it comes to making a live-action anime. Animation is a wonderful medium and has a magic all its own that often live-action cannot emulate. The animated Lion King is beautiful with bold colors, strong visual compositions, and emotive characters with specific designs. The live-action Lion King is missing much of that, at least when it's not recreating exact shots from its predecessor. I don't know who this movie is going to appeal to. Parents will be better off just playing the original for their children at home. Die-hard fans of The Lion King might enjoy seeing their favorite story told with plenty of cutting-edge special effects magic. I would have been happier had the filmmakers attempted something like Julie Taymor's transformative and ground-breaking Broadway show. I would have been happier had they just recorded the Broadway show. The new Lion King is a lesser version of the 1994 movie, plain and simple, and if that's enough for you, then have at it. For me, these Disney live-action remakes are making me feel as dead in the eyes as a photo realistic lion.

978169836,Ashlynn C,"Whilst the visuals are amazing and very realistic I couldn't fully enjoy this movie. It lacked the expressions in the characters due to the animals being too realistic and that really ruins the movie. While I don't want to discredit the hard work that went into this animation, it just doesn't work well for this movie. Especially when the original Lion King was more vibrant and emotional. I was able to feel the Mufasa's betrayal in that movie while in this one, I couldn't even tell Mufasa was shock if it wasn't for the voice acting. And that brings me to my other problem. This movie relies to heavily on the voice actors to show the emotion in the characters yet it just looks odd when the faces of the animals aren't dynamic.  Overall, it's a nice remake with some nice changes but it's not worth seeing when you can't even tell the difference between Simba's sad and happy face.",2.5,2019-07-24T14:41:34.871Z

976042993,Chasha M,"Thanks to technology, we are now in the age where we can animate realistic animals that most of us only get to see in documentaries. That was the Lion King - a documentary where the animals could speak and had a bit of personality. And that was the only great thing about this remake – the realistic visuals which are, simply put, quite BRILLIANT.
Aside from the genius photorealistic animation, the Lion King was a miss. Half the time I was waiting to see a National Geographic logo or a ‘'special thanks to Animal Planet'' shout-out just before the credits. The remake had all the personality of a souped-up nature documentary. What made the original Lion King stand out was the emotion, Timon and Pumba's humor, the strength and majesty of Mufasa, and the loyalty of Zazu. The original Lion King was more than just words and voices, it was emotion, timing and delivery. I guess that's too much to ask to make a NatGeo lion emote, but even Bumblebee from Transformers had more emotions. And he was a machine.
I get it, it's a bit difficult to add frowns to realistic buffalo, but they could have made up for it by adding more depth and passion in the voice acting. I know they can do it, they did it with Scar. He may have had the same facial expression when sad, happy, evil, while singing but boy did he play the bad guy like a pro. I cannot say the same for the other characters, especially Mufasa. While I am glad they had the original voice for Mufasa, the voice acting this time around felt like watching David Attenborough play 007. Don't get me started on the most pinnacle scene in the entire movie, the death of Mufasa. My friends and I still talk about how we all cried for weeks after watching that scene, and it still hurts just thinking about him falling. In this movie it felt like it was quickly recorded in the studio and synced with a rushed scene. It was, in a word, disappointing.
If this is the direction live action movies will take, maybe they should stop making them. I don't understand why one would want to make a very realistic movie-documentary, spend a lot of time and effort perfecting the visuals but falling short on the actual characters in the movie. Not only does it butcher the movie but takes away the one thing that made us all love the movie in the first place, EMOTION. For the next one just allow them to move their f** eyebrows, make them speak ‘more realistic', make the damn monkey do kungfu. If I want to watch a nature documentary, I will turn on Animal Planet, but I want to watch Lion King so please do not ruin our childhood for the sake of realism",2.5,2019-07-24T14:17:52.033Z

977817116,Jacob K,"this has GOT to be the worst disney reboot movie they have made in a LONG time:

1) it's note by note the same movie
2) the cgi is so ugly that my eyes kept fasing in cause all i kept seeing was almost white dirt and pitch blackness
3) i was in a theater watching this and everyone was stuck to the screen, and not in a good way, i thought they all were just copying how emotionless the charecters looked, they all look stoned out of their fucking minds
3) the cgi is SO bad, that even tho i know what was gonna happen in the movie, i got mixed up on which lion was which. Simba, Mufasa and Scar have very lil changes, other then scar's scare. Nala and young simba look IDENTICAL, and the same goes for older nala and sarabi
4) they COMPLETELY cut scenes out of the movie, to make room for (i kid you not i left the theater at this point for a 2 minute break after looking at this) a bit of simba's hair floating with the dust cloud after he flopped on the cliff at night, and that single strand of hair drifted for 3 FUCKING MINUTES, to get eaten by a girafe, shat out, and then a lil dung beatle rolls the lil shit ball up, with the hair still sticking out of it, and going off into the next scene . . . i'm fucking baffled by this
5) the fact that i bring up how bad it is, people just think i'm racist cause ""oh, cause you don't like african cast movies now"" and just wanna fucking make an excuse for liking it cause it's ""new""
6) The songs are all one take'd. Be prepared is litterally scar just saying the lines, no harmony, no syncing with the melody, just him talking and the hyaenas just hum the song

out of 100%, i would give this probably the same rate as food fight and the nutcracker in 3d, and thats like high 10% - to low 5%",0.5,2019-07-24T13:46:08.777Z

When the animals are that realistic all emotion, heart and soul are gone, it's time to concider whether this tool of storytelling is fitting for the story - it's hard to put an emotion-driven musical with antropomorphic singing animals in a realistic setting. It had a couple of decent tings going on, but Disney should listen to the owrds of Mufasa and start remembering who they are - people who want to present great stories to children and adults all over the world, or a soulless corporation that cashes in on nostalgia by copying the work of their former artist and slightly change it to make twice the money the original did?

978118848,Edgar B,"I don't want to spoil too much but lack of any facial expression it really kills some of the magic of this movie, especially because if we cared so much for those characters in the original movie is because we emphasised with those characters. 
I understand that in order to look more realistic the animals cannot have the same facial expression than humans. But for God's sake, animals don't talk or make jokes or dance either. They could have at least give them a little bit more of expressivity, so when I look at Simba's face after Mufasa's death, I can see sadness. Or when Scar tells Simba that he killed Mufasa, to see in Simba's eyes the surprise and anger. But there's nothing of it because ""it wouldn't be so realistic"".

But if there's something that really bothers me of this movie is too see what they did to my favourite Disney villain, Scar.

I could write an essay about how stupid is to hide fascism and it makes worse for new generations to identify how dangerous is that.
The mythical scene and song of Scar on Be Prepared where he looks like a Lion Hitler is just amazing and, at the same time, it sends a message to the kids telling them that is wrong and is what villains and bad people do.
And what's the motivation for that change they had? Political Correctness? That someone might be offended if there's any representation of real things that happened in this world?

Hiding our history and bad things we did it never ends well. In order to be prepared and identify dangerous behaviours and politics we need to know our history and to no be afraid of talking about it and having representations on movies.

This remake has become the worse remake Disney has done so far. 
And my message for Disney is: next time just make a new and original movie. You have talented screenwriters. You made amazing movies and characters in the past. There's no need for these remakes, is just laziness. I understand you want to make money but you are Disney, we are gonna watch whatever you do. In fact, if you make a new and original movie you are gonna make even more money probably and you are gonna get more fans. But right now your only target is people that grew up on the '80s and '90s and making them go and watch the remakes of their favourite animated movies, and you are pissing them off.",2.0,2019-07-24T11:17:59.312Z
260269802,,"This one honestly saddens me. I really liked the original growing up. But this one is less than a shot for shot remake unfortunately. The first half of the film was excellent, it gave itself enough build up to each scene (while basic in every film), and took the shot for shot formula that it’s given and really did it perfectly. But once Simba grew up, the film gets so lazy. The movie just kinda flows effortlessly with laziness, things just end up happening that completely lack build up and emotion. This is incredibly noticeable in the climax, about 3 sentences of dialogue for the two characters that oddly enough, feels unnatural, then it just cuts to the battle. The issue is it needed more build up to the scene, give it some more dialogue, emotion, and depth as well as meaning to the climax. It’s just lacking and this scene is just an example of this, the whole second half of the film is like this. The voice acting is well done, except Donald Glover as Simba just doesn’t fit Simba and felt like a miscast. His performance isn’t the issue, he just doesn’t fit Simba and it feels very odd. Nonetheless, the CGI is absolutely stunning and is worth buying a ticket for in the best screen possible. All together it’s another unfortunate cash grab by Disney, with absolutely amazing CGI, visuals, and a great first half, but the poor writing, pacing, and lack of general build up in the second half is more than noticeable, which left my group and I unsatisfied. I recommend checking it out for the visuals alone, but the original is much better overall. 4/10",2.0,2019-08-24T00:11:34.664Z

- Nala's voice.. ruined the character. I love Beyonce but that's all I could hear.. Beyonce, not nala. It's literally the same voice we hear when she's doing her interviews.. it was not a good pick and just didn't do it for me
- BE PREPARED! Once of the BEST songs from the 1st one was shortened to less than half its original length and was nowhere close to being as captivating as it should've been.
- Scar was not the same character. His sass, sarcasm and deep deep voice just weren't there at all. He was just an old, ill and evil looking lion.. 
- Shenzi and Ed! Where were they? I know shenzi was there and they probably had their reasons for modifying the character but, the hyenas just weren't anywhere close to being as funny as they were in the original. (AND CMON!! Why no Whoopie?)
- The autotuned voices; it's super annoying. Just keep it real, It's no fun to hear autotuned voices when a child is singing a song - it's supposed to be a child's voice lol not an X factor performance (Can't wait to be king). Little Nala killed it tho! :) 
- Last but not least, the hair ball part was just weird and long lol 

Now for the good stuff! 
- Timon and Pumba! BAM! They were life <3 Loved every moment they showed up on screen. Really kept the essence of their characters. Just lovely. 
- The graphics.. omg.. Just the opening made me cry like a little b**** It was absolutely breathtaking 
- Mufasa.. Just waow.. 
- Hakuna matata - THE BOMB
- Rafiki was pretty dope too :)

960720333,,"“The Lion King (2019)” Review (5/10) It seems the Circle of Life nowadays is being a grown man watching a Disney reboot of a beloved animated film from childhood. We’ve had three of those this summer alone, and the latest – a remake of one of their greatest – The Lion King is aggressively mediocre in every department except for the visuals. Jon Favreau's aggressively mediocre retelling lacks heart and nuance. The story remains the same, but if you’re only interested in gawping at the visual boundaries a film could push The Lion King will blow your mind because there is absolutely no way to tell where the ‘live action’ ends and the CGI animation begins. Everything, from a blade of grass to the eyeballs and fur of the lions is 100 percent photorealistic. Director Jon Favreau employs the same hyper realism technique he did in the terrific The Jungle Book, but the results here are far less effective. Making this film hyper real looking exposes two vital downsides of the original – that it has a simplistic story, and cliché and cringey. The original was such a classic because it hid those downsides with beautiful, colourful animation, sympathetic, emotionally charged faces on the animals, and an extraordinary soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Elton John to tug at your heartstrings during the emotionally heavy moments. Favreau removes these very elements in the remake, making this a drab looking film bereft of colour, with the animals having no emotional core, and adds atrocious remixes of the classic songs. Things ‘happen’ in this film – but they don’t carry much weight. Simba’s journey is supposed to be transformational and heroic, but the transitions are too quick and lack energy. The message is very much there – that a man shielded by privilege needs to step out and live with the commoners to gain a better perspective on life, and this remake had a golden opportunity to dig deeper into these themes, but the script by Jeff Nathanson makes no such effort. The final fight isn’t as exciting and emotional as the original, and the same goes for Mufasa’s death. Disney has retooled some of its classic stories to make them more progressive and nuanced, but we don’t see that in this Lion King. The comic relief comes predictably from Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumba (Seth Rogen) but here’s the thing about this whole cast – there’s no shaking away their personalities which are given a bigger focus that the characters in the story. The film pushes celebrity faces rather than good storytelling. If there’s any statement this film makes it is that voice actors need to get back into recording booths – films like these are not going to make less money by giving experts jobs that utilise their expertise.",2.5,2019-07-24T00:33:56.078Z
978169022,R A,"I want my money and 2 hours of my life back.  This movie was a horrible adaptation. Several iconic moments from the cartoon were completely removed. Seth Rogen did nail Pumbaa pretty well, but some of Pumbaa's best scenes & lines were gone.  One scene with Timon and Pumbaa, they even start to plagiarize another Disney movie, instead of doing what actually happened in the cartoon. So sad.   Even the music was lackluster compared to the original. My wife and I watched the original a myriad of times as her little sister and later, my daughter LOVED the cartoon, and watched it over and over.  With the star studded cast they had, I was expecting so much more from it. That being said, I think Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar performance was pretty good too.  He definitely captured the character. But his performance and Seth's, were not enough to save this train wreck for my family and I.

Disney played this movie very safe, they hardly changed a thing from the original. My least favorite part of the movie was Scar. They should have recasted Jeremy Irons to play him. Overall the songs were very underwhelming, especially ""Be Prepared"" which was hardly a song and more of Scar talking about his evil plan. However, the movie did look amazing, it was really beautiful to look at. The animals looked really lifelike, they looked like real animals that could talk. This movie would be outstanding on IMAX. The only downside to the realism was the fact that they had no facial emotions/expressions.

The Lion King is a live  action remake of the 1994 2d animated disney movie of the same name. That's a fact BUT not the know it all end it all because i can't help but feel that the remake set out to complete a different mission than the original and succeeded with fanfares. John Favreau made me believe that real lions had a shakesperian story happen to them.  An odd thing happened to me while i sat in the cinema . I actually got an emotional reaction to the story and it's lessons. The 2D Animated version , i realised, had been too  outlandish , too colorfull for me to care about the message. It felt too detached. (Plus rewatching the original at one point became a visual dopamine dispencer with lack of any depth to me. )The harsch but real looking visuals helped me to trully comprehend what the message was supposed to be. (Even though they did leave out a bit about learning from your past)It had me close to tears to be honest. Now the movie isn't perfect (but neither was the original) and it still succeeds mostly due to it's visual strength. (Like  the original, just with less emphasis on abstraction and more on realism. ) It's not that deep (granted neither was the original, but we're talking about disney here, so it's no surprise we didn't get ""the end of evangelion"" with lions ....althought that would have been funny.)

900752652,Matthew H,"July 19, 2019

While watching ""The Lion King"" (2019), a young couple sat to my left, eagerly anticipating the movie's famous songs, sometimes going so far as to sing the lyrics just before they played. And to my right sat three teenage friends, who occasionally whispered such comments as (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""That's just like the cartoon!""

I've a feeling most people will watch this ""photorealistic, computer-animated"" version of the traditionally animated classic the same way as my fellow audience members, with the ability to recite and recall almost everything about the 1994 original with relative ease, and then take temporarily solace in the fact the remake realizes the story in more or less the same fashion. 

""The Lion King"" is one of those movies that just about everybody has seen. It's the quintessential ""comfort movie,"" with its classical yet still compelling narrative; its vast and colorful imagery; its mostly cheerful and only sometimes tragic tones; and its healthy mix of action, humor and romance. It's no wonder the film was so well received when it debuted 25 years ago and has stood the test of time, thriving in several other forms, from direct-to-video sequels and TV shows to a wildly successful Broadway musical.

But back to this latest rendition, and notice I wrote that viewers will only take ""temporarily solace"" in it, because even though I think people will mildly enjoy this update, I also think their satisfaction will be short-lived. That's often the case when any remake merely meets our expectations without offering much in the way of surprises. I too sat in the theater thinking, this is when the sun rises and ""Circle of Life"" plays, and this is when Timon says, ""Nothing, what's the motto with you?"" Then those things happened, and then…well, they happened, and that was about it. They happened…just like I thought they would.

What's missing after the statement, ""Then those things happened,"" is the word ""but…"" or ""and…"", followed by some new or interesting development of the story. But the movie is essentially the original ""Lion King,"" only in different visual form, with the catch being it's supposed to be more realistic-looking than its predecessor. And for the record, the movie's look is sharp, exquisite and often wondrous to behold. The African landscapes are highly detailed and render magnificently on the big screen, and the animal characters, even in close-up, are palpable and appear about as real as any actual creature. 

Ironically, though, and part of what makes this newest ""Lion King"" such a disappointment, is that in its effort to look and feel real, it inadvertently creates a sense of detachment from the characters and drama. Traditionally drawn animation, through its deliberate intentions to create a world that's surreal and make-believe, has the inherent advantage of automatically getting us to suspend our feelings of disbelief and easily accept the personification of animals. But in this case, when the recreation of reality is one of the movie's main selling points, watching the animals talk looks awkward and we can't shake the fact it goes against nature. It's not cute and entertaining so much as much as it is strange, even disturbing. Oftentimes, it looks like real animals were filmed and their images later doctored with moving mouths and body parts. It just doesn't look or feel right. A movie like ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,"" which was actually live-action, also featured talking animals, but they communicated with one another not by moving their mouths but through some sort of animal telepathy. This I could accept and it's even fun to believe animals really do this, but watching photorealistic animals talking and singing isn't as fun.

I might have been able to forgive the film for the visual uneasiness its creates—and for the record, sometimes I was—had the story engaged me more, but because I'm one of millions who knows ""The Lion King"" by heart, it would have taken a lot for Jeff Nathanson's screenplay to really surprise me. And what's unfortunate is the filmmakers, led by director Jon Favreau, seem to think we simply want to see and experience what we already know, but they're mistaken. 

During this recent trend of Disney live-action remakes of animated classics, the best have been those that put a different narrative spin on old material (""The Jungle Book"", ""Aladdin""), not just a visual one, and sadly, ""The Lion King"" isn't among them. It's practically a shot-by-shot, dialogue-for-dialogue carbon copy, with just a different veneer. 

The movie once again tells the coming-of-age story of a lion cub named Simba, whose father, Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones), is king of the Pride Lands and rules ""everything the light touches,"" including all the animals who inhabit it. Simba will one day take the throne and initially thinks a king can simply do whatever he wants, but over the course of the story, he realizes a true king is measured by his compassion toward others and how he lives up to his personal responsibility. In Simba's case, his arduous journey begins after the death of Mufasa, which his evil Uncle Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) makes him believe he caused. 

It was always the solemn material and earnest message of ""The Lion King"" that made it so special and set it apart from the typically jolly, kid-oriented Disney fare. And just like the original, this new ""Lion King"" balances its gravity with lighter moments of song, dance, humor, and romance, courtesy of a long line of diverse supporting characters, including Zazu the hornbill (John Oliver), the talky yet loyal advisor to the king; Sarabi (Alfre Woodard), Mufasa's wife and Simba's loving mother; Nala (Beyoncé Knowles-Carter), the childhood friend and eventual love interest to adult Simba (Donald Glover); Rafiki (John Kani), the sage mandrill who bestows wisdom on Simba and also has a knack for the martial arts; a pack of ruthless, wandering hyenas (Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, Eric André), who scheme with Scar to kill Mufasa and Simba; and of course, Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), the meerkat-warthog duo who befriend Simba after he's ostracized and introduce him to the carefree lifestyle philosophy of ""Hakuna Matata."" 

Everything we get from this new ""Lion King"" was to be expected, which is also what's wrong with it. Sure, it has a dazzling new look, but it's not necessarily a better look, and like I said, the moving mouths on the animals sometimes proved distracting. This is all even more of a shame to report because, being a fan favorite and worldwide cultural phenomenon, ""The Lion King"" will inevitably gross millions and provide Disney executives further evidence that fans merely want more of what they've already gotten, with only slight variations. This may be what some viewers think they want (after all, ""comfort movies"" do serve a purpose), but I think what they really desire is to be challenged and presented an alternate take on the old material, or better yet, new material altogether. The movie is safe, easy and heartening to be sure, but is it really exciting? The magic and appeal of any story stems from the simple notion we don't know what's going to happen or how, and unless one is completely foreign to the original ""Lion King"" going into the remake, it has little magic and appeal to speak of.",2.0,2019-07-23T21:52:23.049Z

977979335,Michael L,"This is basically just a shot for shot remake of the original, with a couple scenes missing, and while the visuals were incredible, that photo realism can't hold a candle to the stylized animation of the 25 year-old predecessor. Musical numbers fell flat every time (the only exception being the opening ""Circle of Life""). ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Be Prepared"" stick out in my mind especially, because all the vibrant beauty of the former and all the explosive symbolism of the latter are completely gone; replaced by regular looking lions walking in a dull environment (by comparison).

SPOILER for a 25 year-old cartoon:

The scene which I feel suffers the worst you could probably guess is Mufasa's murder. The stylized animation of the cartoon allowed for Scar, with a sneering look of evil, to lean in close to his brother and whisper those most infamous words, ""Long live the King,"" right before throwing him to his doom, and the camera holds a tight shot on Mufasa's face as the betrayal sinks in. Meanwhile, Simba can only look on in horror as his father falls to his death, and it's all his fault. All emotion is lost in this seen; a seen that had me in tears consistently for a decade left me feeling nothing but disappointment and longing for a better film. Scar just looks like a regular (albeit somewhat malnourished) lion, and Mufasa looks much the same. As Mufasa is pleading in recalls images of ""Doctor Dolittle"" and ""Babe"" when they would put peanut butter in the animals mouth to simulate talking. Instead of Scar throwing Mufasa into the stampede, he bats at him like a playful kitten. Simba just looks like an agitated cub, and the filmmakers just stuck a scream over the growl. 


SPOILER OVER:

I know this has been entirely negative, but there were some good things about this film. The first and most important is that this movie may turn a whole new generation of kids onto the original cartoon. The second would be that much of the casting was excellent. Of course, James Earl Jones returns, I actually enjoyed Donald Glover as Simba more than Matthew Broderick, and John Oliver was a decent follow up to the great Rowan Atkinson. I was indifferent to Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance compared to Jeremy Irons; I think both are good for similar reasons. However, why in God's good name did they think casting Beyonce as Nala was a good idea. I thought we learned that she couldn't act back in 2002 with ""Goldmember,"" but at least that was comedy so it wasn't as important that she could hold her own in a scene. This movie (I assume) was supposed to be at least semi-serious, and she drags down any scene she's a part of. Oh yeah, Rafiki was pretty great, John Kani did a really good job.

Conclusion:

While there are many scenes which I could go through, and explain how they fall short of the original, I don't have forever. So, in conclusion, ""The Lion King (2019)"" is an inferior film to the first and hopefully it at least turns a couple of kids from a younger generation onto the masterpiece of cinema that is ""The Lion King (1994).""",2.0,2019-07-23T19:18:48.933Z
978168725,Seth H,"I was a big fan of the original Lion King. The animation worked beautiful, allowing beautiful visuals and incredibly expressive faces. It was colorful and fun, the songs were (mostly) really catchy and good, and the biggest moral can still be applied even today.
This new version is a paint-by-number, nearly shot-for-shot remake that unfortunately falls incredibly flat. Going for a photorealistic look with its characters was a poorly-made decision that unfortunately gave nothing to the story, only took away from the characters. As impressive as the CGI looked, this was unfortunately the wrong story to try to showcase it in, as none of the characters emoted anything beyond dull surprise. This was especially detrimental to Mufasa's death (Spoilers? No, anyone seeing this will have seen the original, so that's not a spoiler at all), as in the animated version you could see the horror and desperation in Simba's face as he watched his father fall. In this one, you saw nothing. No emotion. And the biggest moral in the original, Rafiki teaching Simba that you can either run from your past, or learn from it, was completely cut out of the film. In addition, Scar's song was only barely given lip service, probably because they knew they would not be able to do it well with the technology they were showcasing.
Another unnecessary ""live action"" remake by Disney in the same vein as all the others, purely a cash grab taking advantage of nostalgia, and make easy money, when all the funding for this could have gone towards making some new original animated story.",1.0,2019-07-23T19:12:50.127Z

974807001,ANDERSON G,"""The Lion King"" was one of the biggest expectations of the year, re-reading one of disney's greatest classics with a new, modern, more real, dramatic and dazzling outfit, delivered in parts, of course, the Live Action version of classic animation is a step further in technological terms, as Toy Store did in 95, or even the movie ""Dinosaur"" made in two thousand years, here we have an innovation before our eyes, the movement capture sharpened to a level amazing together with beautiful visual effects. ""The Lion King"" may have some problems, but visually it was amazing.

We all wanted a movie similar to the animation, and so they did, but deep down, we felt a frustration, that of not seeing something new, of knowing the steps following the script, of not feeling the same emotion of the drawing. Coupled with a troubled voice acting - both the Brazilian and the original - and even, a detachment from the characters caused by the passing of more than two decades, are ingredients that end up creating a cold film, we do not feel its update or renewal, It's like looking at something spinning around itself.

Despite the great looks, beautiful scenery, excellent animations, the new re-read of ""The Lion King"" does not match its original, but is nonetheless a good movie, which will serve as a technological standard for cinema and even a readjustment lesson for Disney. .",3.5,2019-07-23T16:22:07.013Z

Disney used to be known as an innovator when it came to children’s entertainment, whether it was animation or live-action. But now, it’s almost as if they’ve run out of ideas.

The CGI in this movie is absolutly perfect, every single animal looks incredible. The movie struggles to achieve the same amount of magic as the original Lion King in 1994. While the music is also incredible it is impossible for the live action version to have the same joy, heart, and magic of the original. Billy Eichren and Seth Rogan were clearly given the most freedom with their lines as it seemed like everyone else was restricted to the script. James Earl Jones does a wonderful job as Mufasa but with age his voice seems to be less powerfull than it once was. Donald Glover was not given much time to come into the role as Simba and struggled to capture emotion with his voice in some scenes. While the Hyenas were henchman (almost bit characters) to Scar in the original they were given a larger role and had much more screen time which I didn't feel resonated well.

868770479,James R,"The Lion King is literally a scene for scene live action/CG remake of the animated film from 1994. Is that a good or bad thing? I found I liked parts of the movie and overall thought it was a good movie, but it wasn't a great movie. The film follows a young lion cub named Simba (JD McCrary) who is the prince of Pride Rock and it's surrounding lands. His father King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) teaches him about the circle of life and how everything is connected. Mufasa rules over Pride Rock with the thought in mind to not overhunt which brings in relative peace in the lands. Meanwhile Mufasa's brother Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is planning a coup with the hyenas ran by Shenzi (Florence Kasumba). After a series of tragic events Simba runs away and is raised by the timid Timon (Billy Eichner) and loveable Pumbaa (Seth Rogen). While some time passes Simba (Donald Glover) is soon faced with his past when his old friend Nala (Beyonce Knowles) finds him and urges him to return to take his rightful place. I could have literally copied and pasted the synopsis from the '94 film and it would have worked. Don't get me wrong a lot of the Disney remakes do a lot of the same retelling, but none of them have been this close shot for shot. I hope the guys that came up with the scenes and storyboards back in 1994 got a cut of the pay here. Even Aladdin (2019) a movie I was a bit middle of the road on was more enjoyable than this since I found it changed enough and brought it's own style and flavor to the story. Other than that huge quip about this film I just found the voice acting fell super flat. The kid actors were very much just reading lines and I have to say yes Beyonce can sing, but she can not do voice acting to save her life! Her moments of dialogue are super poor and were not directed well. I will also say that TImon and Pumbaa save a lot of this movie for me. I found them absolutely hilarious and Eichner and Rogen were great in the role. There was some cool shots here and I did like the scenes with Mufasa, but it's hard to recommend a movie when the original 1994 film is damn near a perfect movie to begin with. The CG animals here don't display emotion and therefore, I just didn't really care. I wasn't connected to this one like previous Disney movies and that's a shame. Kids may enjoy this one (especially those not too familiar with the animated version), but for me this one just didn't work and I find it hard to believe I'll be revisiting this one any time soon.",3.0,2019-07-23T07:06:32.975Z

978168055,Tanner O,"So there I was... On a Monday night sitting next to a pretty girl, twizzlers neatly stacked next to me and popcorn in hand and the movie started. The first fifteen minutes were sheer joy, I couldn't stop smiling when Rafiki and Zazu came on screen. However, I realized to really enjoy this movie I needed to hold the pretty girls hand whom I was on a date with...

I moved my arm to go for her hand and my fresh package of twizzlers fell between the seats like Mufasa falling into the Ravine. I knew all was lost and I had made a very very big mistake. I ate one of the twizzlers I had left in my other hand and gave the other to my date.

I was now shook and disappointed with my clumsiness but knew I would prevail. Waiting for the perfect moment I felt like a squeeky teenage boy again with the same stupid nervous feeling. ""Why am I so nervous"" I asked myself. ""Mufasa definitely didn't wait ten minutes to put his paw on Sarabi's. Give your b*lls a tug and go for the kill.""

I second, third and fourth guessed myself at this point. ""Do I wait until Nala and Simba reunite and 'Can you feel the love tonight' starts playing?"" I pondered. ""Too cheesy"" I thought. So like the lion I am I went in for the kill and put my paw on her paw. 

It was a silent but noble victory.

799709308,Glenn G,"GAY PRIDE – My Review of THE LION KING (3 ½ Stars)
Ready for a hot take?  I don't always love animated films.  Give me the crappy cut-out look of South Park or the gloriously fluid old school Looney Tunes shorts, but otherwise, I sometimes feel like my eyes are bleeding.  I don't mean to take anything away from the incredibly talented artisans who have brought so much joy and wonder to the world.  It's an eyeball thing.  Speaking of which, I also don't like the eyeballs on Disney characters.  They're so big and round and sweet.  I think I know one person in the world with eyes like that and everyone calls him Aladdin, but it's not really a compliment.  Everyone else I know squints and looks dead inside. Maybe I need new friends, or maybe I'm just cranky.  
All of this is to say that despite the cries that Hollywood operates at a bankrupt creative standstill, that cash grabs represent the new normal filled with remakes and reboots, and that cynical decisions only occur on days that end in ""Y"", I don't necessarily hate that Disney has decided to churn out ""live action"" versions of their classic animated films.  As much as I loved the original 1994 The Lion King,  a CGI, photorealistic update sounded like something I could watch without experiencing a cavalcade of onion tears.  I may be alone with this strange affliction of mine, but audiences have sure turned up to see something they've pretty much seen before.  
I enjoyed director Jon Favreau's update on The Jungle Book, but my expectations were truly low for this one.  Using Hamlet as its template, the original film beautifully told the tale of Simba, a young lion who when banished from his pride by his evil Uncle Scar, goes on a journey to discover the importance of standing firm for those you love and realizing your destiny.  The Elton John/Tim Rice songs, while sappy as hell at times, could not be more memorable, and who can resist that commanding drum beat and cut to the title card at the very end of ""The Circle Of Life""?  When that baboon holds Simba up to his adoring animal kingdom, it's one of the greatest cinematic moments of all time.  
Yet there I sat, expecting the worst. Had I hated the film I was going to title my review, ""The Circle Of Lifelessness"".  I expected a pointless remake with expressionless creatures moving their lips to dialogue, but what I experienced instead, while problematic in terms of pacing issues and one particularly not great vocal performance, truly entertained and delighted me. The Lion King 2.0: No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) not only provided me with a more palatable way to view the same story, but it updated it just enough to make it a little more relevant and a whole lot gayer.  
Ok, if you're one of those millions of moms who don't have a gay child, or don't know anyone with a gay child, or you're just a closed-minded, out of touch gorgon, you need to calm down.  The new film isn't outwardly gay, but much like placing Paul Lynde dead center on Hollywood Squares or Charles Nelson Reilly in the top right tier on Match Game, The Lion King has traded in a perfectly wonderful and gay Nathan Lane as Timon the Meerkat for the truly hilarious, scene-stealing and equally gay Billy Eichner.  It's the equivalent of going from Will & Grace's Jack to Bianca Del Rio of Rupaul's Drag Race fame.  The quips feel way more 2019 -more biting, nihilistic, dystopian, the world is ending, in a Years And Years is so dead-on kind of way!  And yes, even though Timon and his BFF warthog friend Pumbaa (a perfect Seth Rogen) aren't technically a ‘shipworthy couple we would call Timbaa, make no mistake, Timon is a gay homosexual and Eichner gives one of the best vocal performances I've heard in ages.  Evidently, he improvised many of his lines, including my favorite as he arrives at a Pride Rock which has been left barren by Scar and his pack of hyenas, ""Talk about a fixer-upper. I think you went heavy on the carcass.""  I think Queer Eye's Bobby Berk should start taking notes!  All of this is to say that Eichner elevates what could have been the draggy second act of the film and sends it into the comedy stratosphere.  
The pacing, at times, does suffer.  Without the benefit of jaunty animation, watching animals traversing the savanna gets a little cumbersome, and the facial expressions of the characters don't carry emotions in the same way.  I actually preferred the new version.  I had no problems deciphering their feelings, and, in fact, I found their edgier looks a better match for our current mood.  It's as if the animals, no longer living in a pre-9/11, pre-Trump world, know we humans have messed everything up and they're deadly serious and seriously pissed off.  Welcome to The Lion King 2.0: The Larry David Version!  
As for the performances, Eichner and Rogen aside, we also get a strong turn from John Oliver as Zazu, the flittering hornbill.  Chiwetel Ejiofor, while no Jeremy Irons, makes Scar a terrifying Iago, although his famous, ""You have no idea"" moment doesn't work as well here since the original was a callback to Irons' unforgettable line in his Oscar winning Reversal Of Fortune.  James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa, because nobody can ever replace him.  Do you hear me, Morgan Freeman?  Nobody!  Not even you!  And you're the Voice of God!  Beyonce acquits herself quite well as Nala, as does Shahadi Wright Joseph as the younger version.  Young Simba couldn't be more adorable and heart-melting.  Try not to go ""Awww"" when he attempts his first roar.  JD MCrary exudes utter cuteness here, especially during his number, ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", but then, unfortunately the movie flatlines when Donald Glover takes over as his grown-up counterpart.   He sounds half asleep and fairly bland in the big duet, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" or whenever reciting lines.  I'm suspecting it's an actor's choice to internalize the guilt and shame Simba experienced as a toddler and turn into a self-serious, lumbering bore, but it's not enough to sink a film with such fantastic moments as ""Hakuna Matata"" or the on-the-beat stomping we revel in during ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"".   
Technically, the photorealism may resemble a National Geographic special, but with better lip-syncing, yet I did find myself missing the darker qualities of the glowing-eyed hyenas and the elephant graveyard from the original.  The wildebeest stampede looks real, which somehow isn't half as scary as a hand-drawn interpretation.  We get more daylight in the new film, making me yearn for the inky blacks of animation.  In either version, however, we enter quasi-religious Aslan territory when Simba speaks to his dead father in the clouds.  That kind of corniness doesn't quite land the way it did in the early 90s.  
Despite its flaws, it's a stirring, impressive film.  It may not have the most urgent reason for existing in that it pretty much trades in one kind of beauty for another, but Billy Eichner is worth the price of admission alone.  Timon may ping on the same old gay best friend character tropes we've known for so long, but it's still a fresh take.  He may yell a lot, but he infuses it with kindness and some genuine affection for his big, dopey friend Pumbaa.  We could all use a little more Billy in our lives right now.

978167597,Philip B,"Beyonce ruined it for me. She ruined ""can you the love tonight"". She made it sound less romantic, too much like soul, added her deep, black voice to it. The original was so romantic and simple. Also Beyonce sounds like she has too much ""attitude"" as Nala, you could tell she was desperate to get her ""artistic fingerprints""  all over the place. 
A lot of voices from the cartoon are legendary voices that you recognize anywhere, like Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, and Whoopie Goldberg! Now we got a bunch of actors, most of whom don't have distinct voices. The movie did a good job at sticking to the original script very much (but not perfectly). The characters are less loud and charismatic. Seriously, how can you compare Narthan Lane's Timon to Billy Eichner. But Disney didn't do the mistake it did with Alladin for example, by completely changing the script and making it a #metoo and #powertowomen message. Unfortunately, you can tell that most voices in the new lion king are black voices and the original movie had whiter voices. Sounds stupid to say, but even Alladin tried to make the genie this ""yo yo yo, I am yo Genie Boiiiie "" I don't know who is choosing actors, and I get it, big names attract  big bucks, But part of honoring the original cartoon is 1) retelling the story exactly the same way and 2) remembering that the audience memorizes voices and accents and is disappointed when they sound different !",3.0,2019-07-22T23:18:41.647Z

976578446,Morgan M,"This film is incredible, regardless of what critics say. No, it doesn't beat the original, but I knew it wasn't going to from the gate of news. But that does not mean it's a terrible film. This remake will be better for those that don't binge the perfect 1994 film at least once a month. For those saying it's too realistic, that was the point of the remake. That and to reach a new generation. Yes, there are scenes where the animals seem emotionless, but the fantastic voice acting makes up for that. For those saying that they didn't change anything and that the remake is pointless, I say they changed too much. It's difficult to try to make an already perfect film better. Simple lines of dialogue that were cut from the original make the audience feel for the characters. I won't say any spoilers, but some characters have slightly changed backstory that doesn't effect the character, and I prefer the actual canon because it makes the audience care more about those characters. The film is beautiful and every moment is entertaining, and the soundtrack is still perfect—even if there is one or two disappointments that makes some sense. But whatever is wrong with the film, whatever nick picks you have, can be thrown out the window simply because of one word. Something that is stronger than any emotion. Something that makes movies enjoyable and moving. That something, that one word, is nostalgia. Nostalgia is the reason why this movie will make so much money. Nostalgia is the main reason why I went to go see it. Nostalgia is why this remake is a masterpiece. This movie is still The Lion King, just not the one you watched as a kid. It's a remake of a perfect film, but that doesn't mean you should expect it to be more perfect than an already perfect film. You'll love it, for one reason, nostalgia.",5.0,2019-07-22T20:00:08.957Z

Jon Favreau, director of many films, including 2016's the Jungle Book, did an excellent job with this CGI remake of the Lion King.
I am proud to be one of several theater witnesses on opening day to watch this wonderfully made film. Although -- admittedly -- the animals don't have a flexible amount of facial expressions, the story, the music, the scenery, to me, is what was most important. I think Jon and the whole cast and crew did a wonderful job recreating a masterpiece, trying not to top it, but trying to expand it a little for the new generation of high film making technology. I did cry a few times, I laughed several times, but my mouth was in awe nearly the entire way through. One of the things that excited me for this movie was the major fact that the legendary James Earl Jones, the original Mufasa himself, decided to come back to play everyone's favorite king of the Pridelands. At age 88, he sounds as though he hardly aged! What a blessing.
Everyone else did a splendid job with their parts, creating emotions through their body language if not through their faces. The crew did beautifully with the realistic visual designs for both the scenes and the characters. The music had me moving so much as it was a near replica of the original soundtrack from 1994 -- only, it was more epic!
Thank you again, Jon, for collaborating with Disney and several other talented people, to help make this movie beautiful, moving, and intense, once again. I look forward to buying this on DVD once it releases!",5.0,2019-07-22T18:31:27.581Z

After watching this i realized that not only did it not bring anything additional, it actually retracted a lot from the original.
The original lion king felt full of life, emotion, color, passion, and (most of all) heart. This remake feels completely void of all of that. This seems more like a lame tech demo disguised as a cashgrab by disney to show off their best realistic cgi while making bank off of it in the process. So many things are done horribly in this, problems that not even the original had...
- The songs don't have the same depth to them
- The song ""can you feel the love tonight""  is a great example, Glover did alright i guess but Beyoncé didn't match the theme or tone of the message in the slightest. She was trying waaaaaayyyy to hard and in doing so she literally ruined the duet.
-Along with beyoncé many voices just don't fit in this movie, not sure why they went with more popular rather than more talented voices but it's very frustrating.
Listen i could go on for hours about how this movie just udderly disgraced the original, but the best thing i could say is this:

The movie lacked an emotional wow factor, actually it almost lacks an emotional factor altogether , If we compare it to the original it is no contest, not even close! But that's not what we should be doing so let's not go there. Just as a new movie itself, lacking that emotion, enthusiasm, even the connection for the most part really hurt it for me, I was entertained visually , but if I am not connecting to the characters especially Simba so I can have a full grasp going in then why should I be connected to the entire story? The twist with the real life (inner voice) method was a good idea but why take away the raw emotions? I seen Simba obey on command even though he's supposed to be a feisty cub, I seen parts rushed and semi- confusing like when Nala meets Simba again and she pins him and automatically after the ""Nala"" sound from Simba, Nala figures it out right away knowing that he's supposed to be dead 🤦‍♂️... There's a lot of others but that's a BIG example and how the movie forced me to lose connectivity to the characters I've loved my entire childhood , and for some it may have brought a different feeling, but because I get this way the entire movie , I'm sure there were other who felt this way as well",2.5,2019-07-22T15:33:39.372Z

The first half is strong, and changes made to Scar and the Hyenas really compliment these darker versions of the characters. Timon and Pumbaa are the highlight, they had the whole theatre howling. At the end of the day, the 2019 Lion King is not the original, and it could have never hoped to be.

As an 80s born kid who grew up in the 90s, The Lion King is my all-time favorite Disney movie. With that being said, and with all due respect to a legend, they should not have brought James Earl Jones back. He sounded like a shell of his former self. There are scenes that are shot-for-shot from the original, to include the dialogue. There's also some new stuff that was really good. Nobody did bad in my opinion, but the emotion and feeling wasn't there. Even the CGI lions didn't have the emotion that the animated version did, which took me out of certain scenes and made me appreciate the animation of the original. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show and had some great new and old lines. Their energy is something I wish every voice character had. The hyenas were pretty good as well. I liked Scar and they added a little more back story in this one that made you understand Scar's motivation. I don't want to give away a scene, but in a particular moment, you realize how Scar got his scar and how he returns the favor. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, even with all my little nitpicks.

It was SPECTACULAR and definitely nostalgic (I cried buckets of tears even though I've watched the original version a million times)! If you love animals, breathtakingly beautiful sceneries, and The Lion King classic film as much as I do, then this remake won't disappoint you. 
 
P.S. Timon and Pumbaa were hysterical! They were certainly the stars here! 

P.P.S. There were some minor changes, and I really missed Scar's original voice. Still a great film though. I'd watch it again, for sure! ",5.0,2019-07-22T14:46:27.606Z
911696204,lvar M,"I'm not going to lie, I actually liked it. Ever since it was announced, I was a detractor of the whole idea; I mean, can you really improve upon the original in any way? Well, it turns out that you can. Sadly, that improvement is exactly what makes it a lesser film.
How is that possible? you might think, well let me elaborate a bit on that idea.
The movie is a technical achievement, probably on the same league as Avatar a few years ago (or Star Wars when it was first released). The CGI characters of this movie, all the setting, environment, and physics, in general, are stunning. It really looks like real life. You can rarely notice something out of place and it is usually when these animals behave in unnatural ways (like speaking, more on that in a moment).
So, long story short, the movie looks stunning. If the animals were not singing and talking all the time, you could even be fooled into thinking that this was a National Geographic documentary, not a Disney musical.
This realism is the movie's biggest problem because characters act like actual animals, so they lack expression and emotion. You can feel it through their excellent voice acting, but it does not match with what you are watching. These animals are not acting, they are just saying their lines while doing very realistic animal stuff (like a lion moving from side to side, or a bird randomly moving its wings). That removes part of the charm of the original movie, where characters show human emotion and the lack of realism in some parts doesn't really affect the movie.
Other than that, it is actually the same movie. Same dialog, same songs, same structure, and just minimal differences that most people won't even notice or mind.
I'm not sure if it was a good idea to remake The Lion King, but the result is worth watching, seriously, it is an unprecedented level of detail in CGI.",4.0,2019-07-22T14:44:04.476Z

Each time Disney took creative liberty with the remakes of their classic animations, the result was never good. Take Dumbo for example. What a nightmare that film was. Nothing of the original was kept and the result was lamentable. With The Lion King, we are almost at a frame per frame recreation of the original material and that is exactly what this film needed.

He had his own spin on the character but keeping the dark and sarcastic humour which makes Scar. He even seemed to bring a more sinister side which the 2D version did not. I think the new Timone and Pumba where a class double act and stole the show at times! Eicher and Rogen in my opinion topped the original billing and 
their chemistry and back and fourth was believable as though they had been a married couple for years. Mufasa's death was even more tear jerking than ever imagined.

Everyone is phoning it. in. Except for the poor animators who had to animate the dead eyed emotionless animals.
It's not even like Beauty and the Beast or like Cinderella, who tried to retell the story. Regardless of the quality of these movies, it changed things. Made something new. At least, made meta commentary on the films they came from.
Lion King is one of the most complex stories in Disney's history. Instead of expanding upon the world, addressing issues with the plot, or making any sort of commentary on... Anything, really.... They just made a very expensive, ugly, lifeless carbon copy of the classic. 
There's a reason why the 94 version sticks with people. The visuals, the story, the music... All Of which this version kills like it's Mufasa.

974395213,Lilia F,"Quando o Live Action foi anunciado fiquei bem apreenciva. Principalmente quando Jon Favreau foi confirmado como diretor dele, particularmente porque o Live Action de The Jungle Book dele me decepcionou bastante.
The Jungle Book sempre foi um dos meus filmes favoritos de infância e pra mim todas as mudanças dele acabaram com a essência da história.
Mudanças essas que foram em grande parte causadas por Jon Favreau, por tanto essas escolha da Disney tinha me causado preocupação.
Porém devido ao seu excelente trabalho em Iron Man, e pela minha fé que a Disney jamais conseguiria destruir algo tão esplêndido quanto O Rei Leão, eu dei a ele o benefício da dúvida.
Quando as críticas começaram a sair eu comecei a ficar ainda mais preocupada, porque muitas pessoas que amam o filme original acabaram não gostando muito da nova, mas nunca fui de seguir o que os outros falam, mantive minha fé de que o filme seria incrível.
Eu quis tanto que esse filme fosse um experiência única pra mim, que eu deixei pra ouvir a nova trilha sonora e ver entrevistas com o diretor e os membros da produção um dia antes de ver o filme. Coisa que eu nunca faço. Só pra não perder nada da experiência do filme. Fui assistir o filme com o coração e a mente completamente abertos, esperando as surpresas que Jon Favreau me daria.
Ele me emocionou logo no início, ao ver a cena de abertura com The Circle of Life meus olhos se encheram de lágrimas, parte pela fidelidade ao desenho outra pela nostalgia.
Pra falar a verdade o filme me emocionou em diversos o filme me emocionou bastante, meus olhos se encheram de lágrimas na morte de Mufasa, no ""banimento"" do Simba, em Can You Feel the Love Tonight, no ""Remember Who You Are"" e no Final.
O Filme em si é bem impressionante, mesmo sabendo toda a história, seu visual o torna completamente breaktaking, é quase difícil acreditar que a maioria de seu cenário seja Chroma Key.
Assim como é difícil acreditar que seu animais sejam inteiramente CGI.
Durante diversos momentos me senti assistindo uma produção do Animal Planet, Discovery Channel ou NatGeo.
Até que os animas começavam a cantar, e assim ele se tornava aquilo que talvez seja o mais próximo que teremos de uma produção Musical feita pelo Animal Planet.
Os animais são tão reais que parece que foram adestrados só para o filme, seus movimentos em si foram tão realistas que fascinam.
E talvez essa realidade utilizada nos animais tenha sido responsável por uma das coisas que mais incomodou o público: a falta de expressão nos animais.

Em entrevista dada pelo AdoroCinema o Diretor Favreau explicou que tem um movimento sutil em seus rostos, para que não se tornassem apáticos, mas que a maior expressão fica por conta do corpo, já que leões, e animais em geral expressão muito do que estão sentindo no modo como se movimentam, ou não.
A maior prova disso está no Vilão do Filme: Scar. Tpda vez que ele aparece em cena com seu andar lento e pesado, como se estivesse prestes a atacar a qualquer momento, prende completamente a atenção do público esperando sua próxima ação.
Talvez o que torne o Scar do Live Action mais assustador, além de sua aparência abatida, seja justamente sua imprevisibilidade, que nos deixa completamente sem noção do que irá fazer a seguir.
O arrebatamento e a nostalgia que o filme traz, faz com que seja quase impossível falar qualquer coisa ruim sobre ele.
As alterações feitas no filme também foram em prol de deixar tudo ainda mais real, por isso talvez a exclusão de algumas cenas sejam justificáveis, mesmo que tenham feito falta.
os quase 30 minutos a mais que diferenciam a história atual da de 1994, serviram para fechar algumas arestas deixadas ou para alívio cômico.
O fato é que a história de O Rei Leão é tão atemporal e maravilhosa, que faz com a ela seja sempre eternizada no coração do público.
Uma história que marcou tanto uma geração, que explica o Ciclo da Vida, que explica sobre vida, morte e amor de uma forma tão pura, linda e cativante, e que agora chega novamente para uma nova geração, talvez + tecnológica, mas que apesar de tudo manteve sua essência e pureza.",4.5,2019-07-22T05:42:53.072Z
905269955,Gabrielle C,"The Lion King (2019) was visually stunning and a true testament to how far technology has advanced in the industry. A lot of people were up in arms about how the characters showed a lack of emotions through their facial expressions. Critics must realize that this is supposed to be as realistic as possible. Animals in reality do not emote through their faces, but rather their body language. However, I think the characters did show emotion in different ways. I was brought to tears several times throughout the film. The story of The Lion King exceeds any minute criticisms such as this.

The musical score was absolutely brilliant (Hans Zimmer, duh). It brought so much nostalgia back and reminded me of why I fell in love with the animated version as a kid. Standout performances were Billy Eichner as Timon and Seth Rogan as Pumbaa. They were absolutely hilarious and captured the essence of the original characters. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was also a standout and an excellent casting choice.

The problems with this live-action version? It was a shot for shot remake of the original. A part of me wanted that, but another part of me desired something new and fresh. Nevertheless, The Lion King is an iconic and beloved story. There's probably nothing they could have done to revolutionize it a part from the outstanding visuals and CGI. 

Not nearly as amazing as the original animation but it deserves more praise contrary to what film critics have expressed. Personally, this may be my favorite live-action remake thus far. ",4.0,2019-07-22T05:40:31.428Z

Decent soundtrack. The environment looked great.

Despite the story being a carbon copy of the original Lion King, it feels much slower paced, and it vastly outstays its welcome. 

The lack of color, relative to the original animated film, makes it seem like it would be less attractive to children, and at times there isn't anything particularly interesting to look at on screen. Also during the final battle, it can be difficult to distinguish between Scar and Simba due to darkness.

These three factors together, along with the inherent but understandable lack of originality, make for a pretty boring film, and by the halfway point I found myself checking the time.

945633444,Travis H,"Take Animal Planet, and add some cute songs and funny one liners, and that's what you have. The animation is fabulous and very lifelike, which takes away the charm that made the original an all time great. The hyenas are down right scary instead of likable, nitwitted villains. Scar does not have the baritone, evil voice that everyone remembers. Timon and Pumbaa lack the likability and goofiness. Perhaps the biggest issue is that there is no dancing and choreography, which was the most memorable part of the original. Since the animals are lifelike, they show no emotion.

I would have respected it more if it was EXACTLY like the 1994 film , script and all. That would have been suitable because everything else set aside I enjoyed seeing actual animals re-enact. It would have just given another perspective of a classic. Scene by scene just set the anticipation of knowing what words are going to be said but then being disappointed when they weren't used.

Beyoncé however did a fantastic job singing her part. Simba, Timon and Pumbaa were wonderfully recreated while Rafiki's character was completely ruined in this remake. Overall, the movie is a digital masterpiece, but the lack of emotion makes the movie simply, boring.  ",2.5,2019-07-22T01:57:06.577Z

978166205,Mark R,"Disney has lost the magic.
In making this original into a life-like story, they confined the story to realism. That means much of the emotion, comedy, and movement of all the characters is restricted to what an actual lion would do. Mufasa dies and Simba's grief just isn't communicated to the audience. This also breaks immersion as I often found myself thinking these are talking cats and the communication just isn't there. 

It's fair, I suppose, to judge the story by itself and not compared to the original. But even in doing that, the character's movements are stiff, the emotions are dry, and the songs are empty. The best part is just how amazing the CGI is, but that's really where it ends. 

I recommend passing on it. ",2.0,2019-07-22T01:18:06.765Z

Very faithful to it's original version, plus it includes some other new scenes (and characters) that fit perfectly with the story. Each beloved character was developed to perfection. And finally it is worth mentioning that something that I loved was the soundtrack by the same composer of the first film (Hans Zimmer) It's almost like an updated version of the soundtrack of the animated film. In conclusion, I would call it an audiovisual masterpiece. There is no doubt that this movie is a roller coaster of emotions. From my point of view, this film has perfected the animated version that came out in 1994.

The big piece for me was Scar- Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones are the most iconic voices of the original - they should have recasted both. Scar just wasn't nearly as menacing or memorable in the new version.  I do think the original is much better- the characters being animated can have more expressions, some scenes are better in the original like the Graveyard enemies and ""Be Prepared."" 

But there's so good things I liked in this version too. I liked in the new place they had other animals - always thought it was weird in the original it was just Simba, Pumba, and Timon. 

It's not the original and it never was going to be. But I think Scar has me the most set back. I felt the casting for everyone else was good!",3.5,2019-07-22T00:57:15.075Z

They cut memorable lines and replaced them with nothing of substance, which is baffling when you consider how long this film is. Be Prepared is turned into a MUCH shorter spoken-word solo for Scar, Shenzi is made the serious and severe leader of all the hyenas while Ed has been replaced with another hyena who talks (ruining the dynamic between the three).

Just because you can take a brilliant ground-breaking Disney Animated Classic and retell it scene for scene, word for word and song for song with CGI doesn’t mean they should have. No fooling around here, this is the most pointless movie the studio has ever released. Thankfully we have the AMC Movie Pass which made it easier walking out of the theater before it ended, something we have never done with any movie ever. The only possible upshot of the CGI LK and it’s slew of negative reviews is it will serve as a wake-up call to Bob Iger.

974648796,Jessica  K,"First of all, the special effects in this film are outstanding and you can see all of the effort that went into it. All of the animal's act like their actual animal counterparts if you saw them in the wild. Timon, voiced by Billy Eichner, and Pumbaa, voiced by Seth Rogen, stole the show in their scenes. They both were perfectly casted and brought some of the humour in this film. For the rest of the cast, I can't really say the same thing. Don't get me wrong Donald Glover/Childish Gambino, who voices adult Simba, and Beyoncé, who voices Nala, did decent enough jobs with their parts and I could easily hear them with their parts but others just needed a change in casting. My main problem with the casting was with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar I just couldn't hear him as the villain. Trust me I tried to forget about Jeremy Irons but I just couldn't. Jeremy Irons made this character iconic for a reason and I feel like if they got somebody else it would have been a bit better. This film added forty extra minutes on to the run time, probably to show off the effects, but you can feel it especially when they change something or add something in. For me, this happened at the ending where they changed not just one of the funniest scenes but also made a scene longer than it should have been. The songs in this version just didn't give off the same spectacle as in the original version. The original used the sets and lighting to help bring you into the numbers this one has nothing to make you interested in them. At certain points, the lighting would change for no reason. What I mean is that it would be Day time and then just a couple of seconds later it would be dark. But hey, at least we have another great score by Hans Zimmer. In the end, The Lion King (2019) just doesn't live up to the original. If nothing else is showing and you need to beat the heat this summer than go ahead and check it out but if not just stay home and watch the 1994 one.

Everyone going to see this movie isn't going to find out what happens but is going to relive our childhood and share it with our kids. The VFX team really did an awesome job though.

909577241,Patrick C,"When you read about the movies heart above you have to wonder what that really means. But after seeing the movie today I figured it out. Most of the blame for the  films problems comes from it's director Jon Faverau who was only asked to do this version because of his experience on The Jungle Book. Faverau was a perfect pick for JB because his age is much closer to the actual Disney classic. In this case he was about 30 years too old. He removed some of the classic lines from the film that made it a huge hit and even removed a few of the memorable scenes that gave the original it's humor. This version is extremely bland with little humor to be found. Surprisingly I even found James Earl Jones to be below par for his epic voice as Mufasa. In the original he delivered lines as if he was actually in the role where here he just seemed to be reading them. Little things omitted like his word of ""brother"" in his fateful fall didn't have the same power as the original. I found the movie to drag and was no where close to the greatness the 1994 classic had. Was very disappointed!",1.5,2019-07-21T23:08:14.811Z

If the emotion is going to be lacking because of ""realism"" than the actors better be able to supply the emotion and they didn't.  Even James Earl Jones sounded less than emotional.  Baby Simba should have had a catch in his throat trying to wake his dad up and instead that scene was boring and dry.  Scar lacked any of the wit, snark, or charm that his animated character had.  He just looked old as hell and was just cruel. The hyenas weren't funny in the slightest.  Beyonce's added song did not fit the scene.  All the added scenes were too long and pointless.  Did we need 4 minutes of a lock of hair traveling to Rafiki? I really didnt need to watch a dung beetle roll a ball of shit tbh.

If I put myself in the place of a young person who is not familiar with the 1994 animated version, and this would definitely be my Lion King. Because some of these voices  are super distinctive (John Oliver, Seth Rogen, Beyoncé), I found myself trying harder to forget the famous person and lose myself in the performance. The same goes for some of the self-aware jokes. They take me out of the story a little bit. The headliner performances are great including Donald Glover (adult Simba), Alfre Woodard (Sarabi) , Florence Kasumba(Shenzi), JD McCrary (young Simba) and the irreplaceable James Earl Jones (Mufassa).  This is where thing diverge a bit for me. I debate whether I would like to have heard a Jeremy Iron reprieve Scar over Chiwetel Ejiofor's still perfectly good performance.  Rogen and Billy Eichner do kill it as Pumba and Timon.  For the first hour I was really aware of the technical CGI wizardry that director Jon Favreau and company are laying down, but eventually I did fall completely to the story telling spell. Would the exaggerated eyes and mouth movements, animal choruses and background changes of drawn animation be better? Was the old one simply more movie magical?

978164006,Egan  M,"This film is amazing, I am not a great fan of Disney and I don't often watch many movies by them, with the exception of Marvel, but Lion King was my favourite when I was younger and this film did not disappoint. Sticking true to the original material from the 1994 version. Changing only the voice actors and of course changing it to live action.
The voice actors didn't disappoint either with a star power like no other with household names like Donald Glover and Beyoncé getting on board playing the main characters Simba and Nala. As well as comedic excellence from Seth Rogan who portrays Pumbaa and Keegan Michael-key who plays the joke cracking hyena. They all add a little flare to the characters and can easily be recognised from one another. 
The live action element also added a heightened level of realism, something animated movies especially Disney lack in. All the animals lion, hyena, warthog and so on were fully realistic allowing the audience to escape from the real world more than they would in a less realistic animated film from the 90s. It not only shows how far the film industry and CGI has come but also the great extensive budget that would have been needed to pull off such an amazing full CGI film. 
As I previously stated the film was amazing at keeping to the original source material, but in a way it was made even better by the heightened realism and improved voice acting. The death scenes were even more tear-jerking in Mufasa's case and even more breath-taking in Scar's case, and most of all the songs were made even better by having talented singers like Beyoncé and Donald Glover leading the pack.
Overall, Lion King is a breath-taking film, galvanizing the already amazing original into modern times. Encompassing both star power and heightened realism. Definitely a must watch.

It also revolutionized musical scores thank to Hans Zimmer, my favorite film composer of all time. Jon Favreau directed ‘the Jungle Book’ remake back in 2016. When Disney announced a ‘The Lion King’ remake in development, I felt super nervous about... until they hired Jon Favreau to direct it. I got excited and I made #3 of my most anticipated movies of 2019. The movie came out, I went and saw it in 3D - and I thought it was... OKAY. When the movie faded in to the horizon before the sunset, I smiled instantly because I knew I dug the movie already. The Circle of Life was BEAUTIFUL in live-action. I almost teared up. The rest of the movie, not so different from the original. There are a couple new things in the movie that caught my eye - things that were different from the original. But everything else... it’s a shot-for-shot remake. The vocal performances were outstanding (particularly James Earl Jones, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, John Kani, Seth Rogen, and Billy Eichner).

I was going to rate this digital remaster a 4/5, just like I rated the original. Sadly, I think whoever they hired to retouch the original film's animation must have been drunk. The characters don't have facial expressions anymore. Also, some audio tweeks seem to have made some of the line reads less emotive as well.

They did a mediocre job with Timone, Pumba and Rafiki, robbing them of the humor of their characters and some classic scenes such as the Hula bait scene.

Nothing really can compare to the original or ever be better, in my opinion, not even the Broadway version. I felt this movie met and even exceeded all my expectations. Jon Favreau couldn't have made a better photo-realistic animated version. This movie's graphics were phenomenal, I cried and laughed at the same scenes, the music was just as haunting and touching as I remembered, and I loved the new scenes and dialogue. This movie is definitely not an exact duplicate of the original, trust me! There are so many new takes on songs, scenes, jokes, etc. Though the storyline follows the '94 version closely it is still its own film, and to judge it based on its predecessor's existence is a mistake. Audiences and critics need to view this movie as its own entity.  Just a well-made, not scene-for-scene (contrary to popular belief, but close), beautiful and masterful take on the beloved classic!

Favreau's take on The Lion King, however, is an almost complete shot-for-shot remake of the original. Very few changes in the writing have been made.

978121127,Marianne Q,"I do love the animation! It is breath-taking! Disney could not have done a better job than this story! The casting is superb and everyone did a 'swell job in voice-overs!

What I don't like is that they made it feel so rush when they get to the second-half of the plotline just to get the story going! They cut down Simba's serious conversation with Rafiki about Mufasa, and replaced it instead with Simba's travelling tuff of fur (showcasing Disney's CGI animation on African wildlife instead with the ants, the giraffe, the beetle). Nala's reunion with Simba (and their conversation on going back to the Pride Lands) is too rush! I'm looking for sensuality between these two, but I did not find it here. When the music ""Can you Feel the Love tonight?"" played in the background, it was broad daylight instead of dusk. Overall, I am saying it is a must-see movie on the summer, but watching it once is enough for me. I actually prefer the 1994 original 'cause it has so much heart in it meaning the animated cartoons showcased their emotions through their animated faces. With the CGI lions, that is so hard to do given their emotions are buried in their furry faces. I'm just giving this one a 3.5 out of 5 stars 'cause the nostalgia somewhat kicked in during the first half of the movie. :)",3.5,2019-09-16T00:53:27.544Z

The score and the songs were greatly toned down. The comedy reduced to a few one liners, the expressions, the slapstick, the emotional range (going with realism) was toned down. The melaciousness of Scar, the grandios of Mufasa, the struggle of Simba was all just turned down! Thinking positive, the visuals, some extra scenes, some epanded ideas, yes, good, but they werent properly fleshed out. Some really cool things could have added a lot to the film but it just didn't.

978165540,Michael C,"The live-action Lion King delivers on expectations.  The storyline maintains a nearly identical script from the animated movie.  A handful of scenes did require editing as they couldn't really be recreated in the live-action version.  However, Disney did a great job of keeping the storyline together.  Purists will pick apart differences from the original and live-action.  However, anyone who hasn't seen the animated version will find the live-action a mesmerizing experience on par with the experience purists felt in watching the animated movie the first time.  Disney is doing a great job with the live-action versions.  Purists do not want to see the movie ""changed"" in terms of script and I believe so far, Disney is doing a great job of honoring the past while bringing the content to the modern, live-action form.

Some new songs were introduced in the live-action - definitely liked the modern sound and fit well in the movie.  The biggest complaint would be a handful of the remade songs from the original soundtrack - eh, they just didn't do it for me.

976184034,,"I heard critics hated this film and I tend to agree with them on the poor quality of these reimagined Disney films. However, I liked the new Lion King. Dare I say, my favorite of the remakes. I want to make it clear THIS DOES NOT COMPETE WITH THE 1994 FILM. This film is a B/B- grade at best compared to its predecessor. It is almost a shot-for-shot remake which to traditional filmmaking is ludicrous idea since you could have watched the original film—see how critics responded to the 'Physco' remake. Due to the poor creative “originality” of Tim Burton’s Dumbo, I needed a shot-for-shot film because the Disney writers have lost touch with reality and don’t know how to capture the intelligence of the original films in their screenplays. Maybe shareholders have too much power of the studio or these movies are to pay off bigger projects in the future. One can only assume. At times, I forgot I was watching an animated film. This film will be nominated for special effects and cinematography. Jon Favreau has really pushed the boundaries of 3D animation that at times I thought I was watching a nature show on Animal Planet. This is the best and the negative part of the film. By going realistic, the facial expressions us human recognize aren't there. Mammals have a hard time reading other mammals. This is why 2D animation is a magical medium. You can make a noun—human, place or thing—have human expressions which are easier for the audience to read a scene. Emotional scenes (you know the ones from '94) get lost in delivery because the characters don't look like they are responding the way we understand. Spoiler: Yes, I was disappointed with the short spoken-word version of ‘Be Prepared’, Yes, I was disappointed with the lack of ghost Mufasa, and Yes, I had a hard time deciphering characters from background to other characters BUT—and I mean but—I rather see this remake again over the Dumbo, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast remakes any day. I think the other majority of the hate is coming from audiences who are tired of watching these recreations when they want something new. Disney, the masses have spoken, make original live-action films again! These remakes have become on par with the early 2000s’ direct to DVD sequels.",3.5,2019-07-21T18:34:40.507Z

908245914,Josh J,"There is a special place in hell for whoever greenlit the 2019 remake of The Lion King.  Lol, okay it may not be THAT bad, but it's easily the worst of Disney's ""live action"" remakes. The original Lion King is among my favorite of the Disney animated classics.  So why was I so freakin BORED and unmoved by this atrocity of a remake?  I simply couldn't connect with any of the characters!  Due to the limitations of their facial expressions, the CGI characters in the 2019 Lion King lack the expression, charm and emotion that their animated counterparts had. Sure, they looked like realistic animals, but aiming for realism was a big mistake. 

I also felt uneasy by how derivative this remake was of the 1994 film.  While many of the recent Disney remakes followed the story of the animated versions pretty faithfully, significant chunks of this CGI version of the Lion King were almost a shot-for-shot replica of the animated version. 90% of the script is the exact same as well.  Disney knew they couldn't really improve upon an already perfect movie so they did not even try to make this soulless cash-grab have its own identity.  I feel bad for the people that worked so hard on the 1994 classic to have their work so blatantly copied. During the death of Mufassa, I was thinking how lazy and unethical the directing of the sequence was, instead of crying like I was  supposed to.  The Lion King 2019 may be a breakthrough in photorealistic CGI, but from a storytelling standpoint there is NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE DAMN THING creative or innovative about this film.

Other nitpicks:
1. James Earl Jones lacks the energy in his vocal performance that he did when he voice Mufassa in 1994.  Mufassa, in general, does not leave much of an impression in this film, despite mostly having the same lines.  

2. The character designs for the lions and hyenas lack distinction and it's often hard to tell who is who.  It may be realistic, but as I said earlier, aiming for realism was a BIG MISTAKE!

3. The song ""Be Prepared,"" one of the greatest Disney villain songs of all time, is completely gutted.  Scar really just sings the last verse.  It was a travesty.

4. ""Can You feel the Love Tonight"" is sung entirely in the daytime.  Like, couldn't it have at least been sunset?

5. The scene where Rafki tells Simba about how the past can hurt, but you can learn from it — a great moral and a key theme to the original movie — is also cut.

6. 2019 Scar is intimidating, but he never really ENJOYS or has fun with his villainy the way the Jeromy Irons version did.  As a result, he feels rather one-note and less interesting.

Despite my overall disgust with the movie, I was able to find little things to enjoy.  Baby Simba was adorable and reminded me a lot about my cat.  Timon and Pumbaa (voiced by Bill Eichner and Seth Rogen) were also pretty funny and were the only characters that didn't really lose their appeal in the transition from traditional animation to photorealistic CGI.  Beyonce's vocal work was good, but the script didn't give her much to do. I really wish they allowed Beyonce to sing ""Shadowland"" from the Broadway musical.  The scenery was often pretty. Yeah, I've run out of compliments.  ",1.0,2019-07-21T15:34:38.431Z

978164870,Filip P,"I am a big fan of the original and I was very excited to see this ""photorealistic computer-animated"" version, despite slightly bothered with this remake being a product of blatant greediness on part of Disney. I had seen The Jungle Book in 2016 and loved it, so I was hoping that this remake could at least match the original. However, despite admittedly stunning visuals, this version simply fails to deliver in other aspects.

Let me briefly summarize the positives: 
The visuals are stunning. The score is even better - Hans Zimmer is simply a genius. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar steals the show among voice actors. John Oliver, Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner were all excellent as well. James Earl Jones is the gold standard of course.

Now, let's turn to what I didn't like:
This version is a whopping 29mins longer than the original. Most of that extra material is, however, just that - extra. Redundant. There is one particular scene that is particularly cringe-worthy and stale. The realistic rendering of characters comes at the expense of emotion - the original had a measure of antropomorphism that is sorely lacking in the remake. Beyoncé is the weak link of the otherwise solid cast. It seemed to me that a lot of the new redundant material was added simply to allow for a bigger spotlight for Nala. That's not a problem in and of itself, the problem is that it all felt incredibly forced.

Summary:
I could go on, but I don't want to waste anyone's time - in case anyone is even reading. In spite of the flaws, I gave the movie 3.5/5 stars mostly because the visuals and the music are amazing - they provide for an amazing viewing experience (especially in iMax) and evoke a certain amount of excitement and gratitude in the fans of the original, myself included. However, it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the original in terms of quality. It simply suffers from the lack of warmth in comparison.

978165222,Tim C,"If this had been an original release, I may have rated it higher. However, it was a fool's errand for Disney to attempt to remake their arguably best animated film. This movie is an almost entirely neutered version of the original, with Disney throwing a bunch of names at the problem in a clear attempt to make a quick cash grab from their obvious target demographic.

Fair warning -- ""spoilers"" ahead.

It isn't all bad, of course, so let's start with the good:
- Stunning animation. There is a lot of detail in this movie, well outside of the main characters.
- A lot of the background music has been even better. Except for the song during Simba's return.
- They left thankfully left Morning Report out of the movie.
- The story is largely left in tact with no major modifications to the overall plot.
- Some scenes were improved to remove ambiguity or to add details and context. For instance, effort was given to make it clear in this version that Simba could not see Scar throwing Mufasa off the cliff from his vantage point. Nala leaving Pride Rock was overall improved. I also enjoyed the added details of Simba's fur going on the journey to reach Rafiki.

Now for the points where I feel this movie failed:
- Disney removed everything from the movie that could have been perceived as even remotely offensive or controversial:
	- Replaced Scar's ""shallow end of the gene pool"" with something mundane.
	- Removed every possible reference to Scar's very evident queeniness, including the ""weird uncle"" exchange, ""practice my curtsy"", flamboyant behavior, etc. They turned him into a flat, generic villain of no interest.
	- Removed young Simba scratching Shenzi's face open.
	- Removed the Nazi references between Scar and the hyenas.
	- Replaced Scar knocking Zazu out with just sending him off, instead.
	- Replaced Timon dressing in drag with a product placement for one of their own movies.
	- Super downplayed the sensuality between Simba and Nala during ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"".
	- I'm convinced that Disney would have removed the murder from this movie if they thought they could get away with it.
- The song ""Be Prepared"" was an absolutely brutalized hackjob -- probably in an effort to remove some of the items above.
- The hyena trio was turned into Shenzi and two other characters that you don't know the names of and don't care about. Their new comedy schtick was terrible and flat. The fun dynamic between this characters was entirely gone.
- The overall pacing of the movie -- particularly the spoken lines -- felt rushed and awkward.
- While the overall animation was great, the mouth/vocal animation barely holds up today, and certainly will not hold up to time.
- There's simply no capturing the same level of facial expression when attempting to also make the animals look real.
- A lot of the voices in the movie were not that great, and the ""voice actors"" were clearly chosen for who they are versus what they were capable of.

It is easy to go on, but the ultimate point here is that this movie falls flat. All it did was leave me with a lingering desire to watch the original again. Disney could have easily re-released the original (again) and made millions of dollars (again). The original is a timeless masterpiece. Shame on you, Disney.",2.0,2019-07-21T15:14:45.901Z

Scar seemed unsure with no plans or leadership, Timone had almost no character, and the Hyenas lacked so much character, you could barely tell them apart when they spoke.  Some of the songs were just butchered to the point there was absolutely no power or heart, especially the opening scene which appeared to have actually had the volume turned down, as with several songs.

The animation looks good on the surface, but you cannot feel any emotion, which isn't helped by the mediocre acting that feels rushed and unmotivated. The Soundtrack is not as epic and memorable and the songs feel like copy pasted into the scene, as well as the whole weight of the story not being shown at all. Important points where left out completely and got switched with useless scenes about a dung beetle or Scars prolonged mice hunt. What should have been a decent remake turned into a farce to show that Disney can make money with no effort at all. They trampled on a beloved masterpiece of millions (if not billions) of people worldwide and 89% seem to be OK with that? 

Even if you do not compare it with the hand drawn animated classic (which you HAVE to, since its a REMAKE and not a REIMAGINING), if feels dull, ugly, lazy and leaves no impact at all. 

Disney should be ashamed, but not as much as all the blind and dull viewers, who cannot tell the difference between quality and cash grab anymore.

978165193,Conor M,"The Lion King... 2019 remake of the original 1994 animated original... is it worth watching or not?...

Yes and No!!

. Yes purely for the C.G.I. and the graphics that make the animals look so realistic!!

. No because it is literally no different to the original. All of it is shot-for-shot, scene-for-scene the same!!

If you want to go and see it then by all means but in my opinion, you might as well just stay at home and watch the original. It is no different apart from the graphics are updated and the voice cast is different bar one person!!

My rating for The Lion King is 3 out of 5 stars and I haven't given this because it's a bad movie but just because it is no different to the original. The graphics makes it a good watch but that's about it for me...",3.0,2019-07-21T13:38:18.668Z

970980105,Jacob B,"The Lion King 2019 is mostly like a video game remaster. It's mostly the exact same things, right down to dialogue recited verbatim from the original script but with upgraded visuals to give off a more photorealistic look. I agree that it is essentially a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's very easy to forget that this is all animated conventionally, including backgrounds. On the other hand, the lack of facial expressions and preferences to stick to realism sacrifice some of the more enjoyable aspects. Though with regards to the former, it's not as bad as the trailers and TV spots made it out to be and the voice acting and body language help the animals out in this regard. The music is great, though seeing as how this was composed by Hans Zimmer, who also composed the original, should it have come off as much of a surprise? I will admit that the shot-for-shot criticism that Beauty and the Beast 2017 was attacked for was much more noticeable here for me. While BatB 2017 was a shot-for-shot remake with new stuff added in to pad the runtime, it never felt like one. Here, The Lion King feels like one though I don't really mind since I was never against the live-action remakes. The Lion King ""live-action"" remake probably doesn't need to exist but if you want to relive all the feels the original gave you in glorious 4K, go watch it. Sooner or later, Disney will probably going to run out of remakes...won't they?",3.5,2019-07-21T13:08:25.686Z

906137136,Adam P,"The Lion King photo real reimagining is beautifully rendered but simply cannot overcome its many flaws.  What I take issue with is the film's mishandling of the film's emotionally climactic and ""big"" moments.  The original film struck so many right cords when it came to these moments and unfortunately the 2019 version misses the mark on just about all these moments, making them feel small.  The morning patrol, the father/son lesson, Be Prepared, the stampede, Mufasa's death, Nala and Simba's reunion, Can you feel the love tonight, Simba talking to his dead father and finally realizing what he needs to do.  All these powerful moments feel shallow and disjointed in the remake.  Some of it falls on poor scripting but most of it is a failure on the director to capture the scene and to connect the voice over work with these pivotal moments.  Pleasant surprises include Ejiofor's interpretation of Scar as well as the reimagining of Timon and Pumba.  These three seem to have been the only characters given some degree of artistic license.  Finally, and I cannot stress this enough, all of Simba's voiceover work is awful.  Nearly every line seems to have been performed in a vacuum with no eye toward the animation or what the  other actors were saying.  This was a big misstep from Donald Glover.  There is absolutely no energy in this portrayal.    ",2.5,2019-07-21T12:40:34.960Z

However, the most adversely affected scene was Mufasa's spirit speaking with Simba. In the original this scene gave goosebumps but here the message was not impactful. I also think that this was a brilliant opportunity to dwell even further in to the history of Mufasa and Scar and build it in to an even morr satisfying build up to Mufasa's death.

With a story that is so profound and loved, to change it too much would be a crime, however the 2019 edition adds depth and some background to many of the key characters. The film features many of the lines we know and recognize, but adds in a fresh set of humor befitting of the child and adult audiences alike, as well as an updated soundtrack that truly sets the tone for each segment of this addition.

The Hyena Ed was lame in this 2019 version. I loved Ed in the original with his crazy laugh and him chewing on his own leg. They even changed the original scene where the Hyenas slid down the cliff and bumped into each other until the last one got knocked into the thorn patch. ""There ain't no way I'm going in there. What, you want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt?"" Almost all of the Hyenas dialogue was either changed or left out. Not to mention Scar's ""Be Prepared"" song was completely lame. It wasnt even a song and it was cut short.

It's like Disney dumbed down the movie even though it is a children's film. For example, we all know that when the monkey chalks the tree its about Simba's life. However, we now have to have the money say it, twice. The monkey also isn't a comical character anymore. We are also told all the way though by Scar, at every possible interval, he wants to be King. Its like been spoon fed a storyline. The male lions now cannot possibly be stronger the female lions, and they is forced down our throat at every interval.  

The characters are much less colourful and less animated. They have lost there individual movements and traits, which is a shame.

260299650,,"The Lion King - Movie Review “The Lion King... is cutting edge on a technical level, but it fails to recapture the energy, charm, or magic of the original.” 5/10 The Lion King (2019) is a “live-action” remake of the 1994 animated film of the same name. The original film is considered a Disney classic. With it’s beautifully rendered animation, top-notch voice performances, and stirring drama, the film easily holds up as a classic even today. This new remake, directed by Jon Favreau, attempts to retell the story with photo-realistic CGI visuals and a (mostly) new cast of voices. The result is cutting edge on a technical level, but it fails to recapture the energy, charm, or magic of the original. The Lion King (2019) takes a “don’t fix what ain’t broken” approach to its source material, and the resulting story is essentially the same. I won’t be reiterating the plot here, as most people are familiar with the original film (and if not, you’re probably familiar with ‘Hamlet’). But just to be safe... WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! One of the main draws of this film, aside from nostalgia, is its CGI visuals. It’s hard to deny that this film is beautifully animated. The animals have a life-like appearance, with true-to-life physics and movement, and fur so realistic you want to reach out and touch it. While this film pushes the limits of what digital animation is capable of, it also outlines its limits as a storytelling tool. As one would expect, the animal characters in this film are limited in their expressiveness. Facial movements efficiently match the voices, but are jarringly stiff and lacking emotion, making it difficult to connect with the characters. The voice performances are a mixed bag. James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa, and his performance is captivating. A few cast members do what they can with the material, such as Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles, but they ultimately feel miscast. Pumbaa and Timon add some levity and meta-humor, but the jokes are hit-or-miss, and the talky dialogue borders on annoying at times. The film is intermittently cute, funny, and exciting, but the pacing is clunky. Things rarely kick into high gear, aside from a couple fun action sequences. The drama is often times undercut by the film’s stubborn adherence to realism. The life-like visual style may have its own appeal, but it can’t match the expressiveness of the 1994 film’s bright and stylish animation. Ironically, the original film feels more alive than this “realistic” remake. The plot of this film is as predictable as ever. It’s also roughly 20 minutes longer, and noticeably so. This film drags during its second act, and I found myself wanting to hurry along to its inevitable final showdown between Simba and Scar. Even then, the result is underwhelming, and the film’s perfunctory conclusion is more of a whimper than a bang. The Lion King (2019) succeeds much more as an expensive piece of machinery than as a film. It’s a testament to the power of technology, but not so much to the power of storytelling. It’s a safe, mildly entertaining film for all ages, but if you’re looking to introduce newcomers to The Lion King, you’re better off watching your old VHS or DVD copy of the 1994 version at home. 5/10",2.5,2019-07-21T06:45:25.722Z

Many things fall apart if you begin to question the jungle creatures’ monarchical societal structure. “Hamlet” is not a feminist text, so neither is “The Lion King.” Wow does this movie have a golden cast. Damn does Donald Glover’s voice get me hot. But are you telling me that Monica’s stupid millionaire boyfriend from season 3 got to direct a movie for Disney? Do white men not have enough money? I did think Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen made a convincing couple, while Donald Glover and Beyoncé did not. I did find myself playing animal crossing and wondering if there was another showing of “Crawl” I could sneak into. But then there was a cute animal dance scene that brought me back.

Yes, the technology in play looks incredibly photorealistic. No, ""photorealistic"" is not synonymous with the word ""aesthetic."" Not always, that is. Yes, these are some pretty convincing-looking lions. Yes, that also means you get the added tradeoff of muted emotionality. I simply have to stand by my original opinion on the whole trend -- I don't see why we need to remake so many of these classic films. Yes, we now possess the technology to make these stories appear more realistic. But if trending closer towards realism is something I should come to expect from Disney (Yes.

I think the voice of adult Simba, though he added amazing vocals to Hakuna Matata, lacked power. Perhaps part of it was the directing making Simba have more of a weak, broken down mental state? Many lines and some scenes felt rushed like they were trying to keep the movie short. For example, Nala and Simba reuniting as adults was unbelieveably short, unrealistic-feeling, and disappointing. Additionally, there were some silly-sounding lines (example: ""Lions, attack"" - Nala. Why was this needed? Just jump into battle! They'll follow you!) 

Pumbaa and Timon were funny, and the addition of more characters in their ""paradise"" was a nice touch that made sense. Scar was appropriately scary. The hyenas were accurately matriarchal.

974889714,Gareth H,"Visually stunning, but that's the only positive thing going for this remake. All emotion is lost here compared to the original, the character voice actors are so lethargic, as if no effort or passion went into recording their dialogue. You cannot see the characters emotions, which disconnects you from the film, from beginning to end. I cried on at least 4 occasions during the original, but I didn't even shed a tear while watching this new version. Lastly, the music was better in the original! The music placement is all over the place, with vocals recorded distractingly louder than the score etc. There are a few more issues with the score, but I would have to go into greater detail and I would be here all day ranting lol. This was a huge shock to me, seeing as it's based on what was a perfect score from the 1994 movie.

977929235,Carl E,"What a pathetic, unnecessary, crappy cash grab. Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film.

SONG - Loss umph! Notes were either riffed too much or elongated unnecessarily!
VOICE - Original kept more black / African voices. Sarabi didn't have as much ""queen""; and Beyonce should have altered her voice instead of bringing BAMA to the Prideland.  NOTE: If folks recall, in original, adult Simba voice was teased b/c it was nowhere close to the regal of James E Jones.  In this version, Disney did a switcheroo + now, EVERYone sounded like they didn't belong, with exception to justice that was done to Zazu + definitely Scar's villainous voice. 
HUMOR: Hyenas + Timon/Pumbaa made the original in terms of comic relief. Levity was mildly spread w/in movie duration and overall, much more Flat!! 

When the top 4 animated films were original released in the 90s - Little Mermaid, Beauty/Beast, Aladdin and Lion King - Lion King seemed most celebrated + best compilation of everything wanted in a film.  This time, Disney landed Aladdin just right and the best; they followed with Beauty/Beast next, however they really fell short with this Lion King.

The facial expressions just completely disappeared. Every face you saw was a simple straight face. And I know what you might be thinking ""but realistic animals don't have facial expressions!"" Well in that case why don't you go rewatch the Jungle Book remake. Not only are the animals realistic looking in that movie, but their faces change with their emotion. Really the only thing good about this movie was that it was a shot for shot remake of the original and the original is a masterpiece. And even though this movie is an exact replica of the original movie, it still manages to add 20 extra minutes that nobody wanted. Could this movie have been better? Possibly, if it had been made in a time where a remake seemed necessary and a good idea, in a time where there was a new idea to add something to the original story. But this isn't that time and instead of leaving the original alone they had to give us a remake that nobody was asking for. Let me tell you something Hollywood, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD! There were plenty of other Disney movies to remake, ones that could have been improved upon today, but except they redid a timeless classic that was perfect in every way.

977771724,Jay R,"By sticking to an over realistic representation of nature, Disney killed the magic of The Lion King.  Look, this is a Hamlet inspired story that uses Lions in Africa to tell the story.  You expect some magic and stretching of what animals and nature can do in real life.  However, this movie is just too real. There are several scenes that look more like a National Geographic show than an actual family movie.  Here is a breakdown of the failures of this move:

1. The strict adherence to realism and colors.  Yes it really looks like it was filmed on location in Africa.  But it looks like a crappy cinematographer and film team chose the worst days to film.  The animation (and the plays) are vibrant with color.  So yes, the sky and the sun rising in the first few scenes are jaw dropping gorgeous in the animation. 
The greens in the forest pop in the animation, the water is really bright blue.  They are just blah here.

2. The music - it is just meh.  I have been to high school play versions that are much better.  They just did not have the same enthusiasm as the original or most plays.  They were all just flat, like near the end of a play season where everybody is ready for it to be over.  I almost left the theater to tell them the volume was too low on the intro song until I realized that it was just flat.

3.  The acting - it was overall just too serious.  In the animation Scar was charismatic and charming, you could see yourself falling for his charm and did not fault Mufasa or anybody else for trusting him. He was just down right creepy and bland in this one.  Rafiki is all business for most of the movie, no funny quips, no overt kung fu at the end... No monkey business in this movie.  Oh the Hyenas... Somebody forgot to tell the director that the Hyenas are the comic relief in the first act.  Nope, no funny hyenas in this movie, only hungry, scary wild dogs. In the animation they were the bumbling idiot bad guys with lots of jokes about Mufasa's name and wanting to eat a Wildabeast... None of that here...

4. No visible emotion - Ok, so apparently it was ok to anthropomorphize a human story (Hamlet) onto animals, but we can't let them smile, wink, or do anything else human.  There was a scene in the animation where after going to the animal graveyard Simba is waiting to be punished by Mufasa.  In the animation, when his father calls him, he lowers his head to hide, like a kid (or your dog) might do.  In this one he just blinks those perfect taxidermy eyes and walks forward with a blank stare...  

Overall, just sad.  I am going to wait a few weeks and watch the original and hopes it helps me forget this tragedy.",0.5,2019-07-21T05:50:10.348Z

With the lack of facial expression in the cg animals, we lose the  charisma and connection we felt for the characters. The vibrancy, joy and heart is just lost within the realistic efforts to make this seamless. 
The pacing is also strange. It seems rushed at points in forced dialogue but its still longer than the original. Some songs have nice renditions added.

260255242,,"I really wanted to LOVE this film. But I can not deny the fact that it had many mistakes. The script was almost a complete copy as the original. There were no new surprises, no new character developments, and barely any new songs. A major problem I had with it, was that they assumed that everyone who would watch this film would’ve already seen the original. This assumption led them to take shortcuts within the film, such as Simba + Mufasa’s relationship, as well as Scar + Mufasa + Simba’s relationship. They could have easily fleshed out many relationships, as well as characters such as Nala. My favorite parts of this film were the “new” parts, although there weren’t many. I loved the Beauty and the Beast reference, as well as the conflict between Nala and Shenzi, although those are both very minor parts of the film. Another issue I had, was with Donald Glover. I love Donald Glover, but I don’t think his lines were delivered well, and he was outshone by Beyoncé in “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.”.

883334113,Alex H,"Disney's classic remakes have so far been underwhelming and the lion king was no exception. While the plot stayed true to the original, the charm of some of the characters like Zazu and Rafiki was lost and some scenes were dragged out while others felt rushed.

782492909,,"No facial expressions obviously hurts movie. They ruined the betrayal scene. Changed dialogue from “scar help me, brother” to “scar help me” which doesn’t have as much oomph. Then they made the “long live the king” just a non dramatic moment. Also Pumba and Tamone are more funny",1.0,2019-07-20T21:56:50.725Z
